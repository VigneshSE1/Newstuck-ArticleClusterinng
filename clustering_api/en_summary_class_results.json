                "Summary": " Provided by Hindustan Times\n\nThe Lancet on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens Commission on Reimagining Indias Health System which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage UHC in India The work of the commission will begin on Friday with an aim to publish a final report of its findings and recommendations in the next two years\n\nThe Lancet a global health journal and the Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute Harvard University together formulated the commission which will be led by four distinguished health and business leadersGagandeep Kang a professor at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory of Christian Medical College Vellore and one of Indias leading scientists Tarun Khanna Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor Harvard Business School Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute Harvard University and Director Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute Kiran Mazumdar Shaw CMD Biocon Ltd and Vikram Patel Professor in the Department of Global Health and Population at Harvard Medical School and founder of Sangath They have brought together 13 experts from academia the scientific community civil society and private healthcare to serve with them on the Commission\n\nThe mission of the Lancet Citizens Commission is to lay out the path to achieving UHC in India in the coming decade The commission will take a participatory approach with engagement of all sectors engaged in healthcare and citizens We expect that the commission will formulate a roadmap for realising a resilient health system that offers comprehensive accountable accessible inclusive and affordable quality health care to all citizens in India Although we recognise the important role that social determinants have in influencing health the focus of the Commission will be on the architecture of Indias health systema commentary in Lancet India said on Thursday\n\nThe commentary also said that despite progress in health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality disease burden in India is disproportionately high and that less than twothirds of children were fully immunised in 201718 malnutrition and other risk factors for disease and injury are widespread The commission observed that the Covid 19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Indias health system ranging from inadequate medical supplies and shortage of health care workers in public hospitals to profiteering by private hospitals Outofpocket payments for health care in India continue to be among the leading causes of poverty for many households An estimated 400 million people could fall deeper into poverty In the coming year as Indias gross domestic product contracts by a projected 103 The pandemic could worsen health disparities since much of the public health system has been redeployed in the Covid19 response the commentary said\n\nData from Indias National Health Mission showed there was a 64 decrease in child immunisation a 50 drop in BCG vaccinations and a 39 fall in oral polio immunisation in April 2020 compared with January 2020\n\nThe commission organised a webinar on Monday where Dr Vinod Paul member Niti Ayog said Ayushman Bharat and Digital Health Mission have laid the path towards UHC A few significant big tickets steps have been taken in the past few years On the human resource front I assure you that we will achieve a doctor patient ratio of 1 per 1000 which is the WHO norm by 2024 Our public spending has to increase we made a commitment to go to 25 of GDP by 2025 which we will follow through Our 15TH Finance Commission has also put weight behind it Twothirds of spending on health comes from state governments State spending should be disaggregated said Paul adding We have a chronic problem of human resources Our specialist scarcity is huge The Commission should think about that granularity We have 20 to 25 of what we should have We need five times the number of paediatricians we have today We cannot do without specialists The Commission also needs to work on infrastructure We have just about one bed per 1000 population Under the national health policy we aspire to be 2 beds per 1000 population\n\nWHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the index thats now used was developed years ago which looks at 14 indicators focused on process indicators We wanted to measure UHC by looking at health outcomes and impact So instead of focusing on distribution of ORS in primary health centres as a management of childhood diarrhoea lets look at mortality incidence ratio for diarrhoea India could innovate in the measurement system to move ahead We have proposed a new UHC measuring index\n\nGagandeep Kang said that all stakeholders will be consulted Engagement must start with listening to issues perspectives goals and preferences of all stakeholders which includes the designers providers and recipients of healthcare services In the next year or so we will make sure we use every opportunity to listen and engage so our framing of a reliable efficient and accountable healthcare system can be realised in ten years\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper

                "Summary": "The Cyclone Warning Division of the India Meteorological Department IMD has release a report on the Cyclonic Storm BUREVI over the Bay of Bengal during 30th November  05th December 2020 The salient features of the Report are\n\nBrief Life History\n\n The cyclonic storm Burevi originated as a Low Pressure area in the equatorial easterly wave over South Andaman Sea and adjoining areas of Southeast Bay of Bengal  Equatorial Indian Ocean on 28th November 2020 which became a Well Marked Low pressure area over Southeast Bay of Bengal  adjoining areas of South Andaman Sea and Equatorial Indian Ocean on 29th\n\n Under favourable environmental conditions it concentrated into a Depression in the early morning 0530 hrs IST  0000 UTC of 30th November 2020 over Southeast Bay of Bengal\n\n Moving nearly westwards it intensified into a Deep Depression in the early morning of 01st December 2020 over Southwest and adjoining Southeast Bay of Bengal\n\n Subsequently it moved westnorthwestwards and intensified into Cyclonic Storm Burevi over Southwest Bay of Bengal in the evening 1730 hrs IST  1200 UTC of 01st December 2020\n\n Continuing the westnorthwestward movement it crossed Sri Lanka coast close to north of Trincomalee near Lat 885N and Long 810E between 2230 and 2330 hrs IST 1700  1800 UTC of 2nd December 2020 as a Cyclonic Storm with maximum sustained wind speed of 8090 kmph gusting to 100 kmph\n\n Moving across northern parts of Sri Lanka it emerged into Gulf of Mannar in the morning and lay centred close to Pamban around noon 1130 hrs IST  0600 UTC of 03rd December It crossed Pamban area around 0800 UTC of 3rd Continuing to move westnorthwestwards it weakened into a Deep Depression over the same region in the evening 1200 UTC of 03rd December\n\n Thereafter the movement slowed down significantly and it remained practically stationary over Gulf of Mannar close to Ramanathapuram district coast for nearly 18 hours and further weakened into a Depression in the evening of 04th December over the same region\n\n Further remaining stationary at the same place for subsequent 18 hours it gradually weakened into a well marked Low pressure area around noon 1130 hrs IST  0600 UTC of 05th December\n\n This system during its initial stage as a Low pressure area had caused fairly widespread rainfall with isolated very heavy falls over Andaman  Nicobar Islands on 29th November It caused widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places  extremely heavy  20 cm falls at isolated places occurred over Tamil Nadu during 02nd  04th December\n\nA preliminary analysis indicate that due the prevailing middle to upper tropospheric environment with a COL region due to two anticyclones on either side to northeast and northwest of the cyclone over Gulf of Mannar the system remained practically stationary for about 36 hrs Further persistence over this landlocked region of Gulf of Mannar led to cooling of Gulf of Mannar through continuous rainfall and upwelling over the region and hence cooling of the sea region Further the increased wind shear and interaction of land surface favoured the weakening\n\nMonitoring of the System\n\nIMD mobilised all its resources to track the system and regular warnings wrt track intensity crossing point  time associated severe weather and adverse impacts  suggested actions were issued to concerned central and state disaster management agencies print  electronic media and general public Regular advisories were also issued to WMOESCAP Panel member

that there is a High 68  100  probability for cyclogenesis over southwest Bay of Bengal during the second half of week 27th November  03rd December Actually the Depression formed over southeast BoB on 30th November\n\nFirst information that a low pressure area would form over southeast Bay of Bengal around 28th November with high 76100 probability of its intensification into depression around 30th was issued in the Tropical Weather Outlook at 1130 hrs IST of 27th November Actually low pressure area formed over south Andaman Sea on 28th November 0830 hrs IST and it concentrated into a depression

significant point in the manifesto for the western region during the 2019 Lok Sabha election The State government has been maintaining that the benefits are many and the expressway will cut travel time by several hours besides leading to the development of the region Parties rallied around the farmers who were opposed to the project and took on the ruling AIADMK that was keen on implementing it\n\nPublic consultations soon\n\nWelcoming the Supreme Court order NHAI officials say they have received the terms of reference for the project and two studies have been done Public consultations will be held soon according to the rules First we will approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board which will be responsible for its conduct Then we will have to take time to seek objections and then award and disburse the amount due says an official Former officials however say the project will be delayed by at least 30 months thus driving up the cost\n\nPoll plank\n\nThe Supreme Courts ruling comes at a time when parties gear up for the 2021 Assembly election and they may look at the possibility of using the project as a plank in the region A Chandramohan State coordinator of the All India Kisan Sabha says farmers are firm in opposing the project The governments at the Centre and in the State will have to risk an electoral setback if they decide to go ahead with the project he warns Parties that have been opposing the project should flag it as a major issue in their manifestos he says\n\nThe High Court had found the process vitiated by the charges of police highhandedness against protesters and submission of a detailed project report with plagiarised content by the project consultant among others The Supreme Court however declared that the competence of the consultant was not challenged by the petitioners and was not enough cause to set aside the land acquisition notification\n\nThe Supreme Court also upheld the legislative competence of the Central government to declare any land a highway under the Land Acquisition Act 1956 something that was upheld by the High Court too when the petitioners argued that it was the State legislature that was the competent authority to do so The Supreme Court also held that it was not ultra vires the Constitution pointing out that the Constitution gives powers and legislative competence to Parliament\n\nThe High Court had questioned the reasons for the sudden change in the sections  from the ChennaiMadurai stretch that was originally conceived under the Bharatmala Pariyojana to a greenfield corridor between Chennai and Salem through Krishnagiri  without the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs But it had stopped short of declaring it mala fide Though the High Court acknowledged that courts should not intervene in policy matters it however questioned the utility of the project It flagged questions over food security as a consequence of diversion of vast tracts of agricultural land and alluded to the judgments from US courts\n\nEC only before construction\n\nThe Supreme Court however rested its ruling on the technical and scientific expertise of the expert committees of the NHAI which is an arm of the Union Ministry that took the decision to change the section The court thereby implied that a judicial review of a policy decision would be unwarranted Further it accepted the Centres argument that the length of the ChennaiKrishnagiriSalem corridor was less than the ChennaiMadurai corridor and it would not entail any additional cost\n\nThe Supreme Court also held that environmental clearance was not mandatory for the notification and it was mandatory only before undertaking construction or implementation of the project According to the court it was not necessary for the the Central governmentthe NHAI to apply for prior environmentalforest clearances or permissions at the stage of planning or taking an inprinciple decision to formalise the project for constructing a greenfield highway Such clearances can happen only after the land is vested with the government once after the notification is made under Section 3 D of the Land Acquisition Act 1956 and not prior to the notification under Section 3 A which is a declaration of intent to acquire land for a public purpose\n\nThe verdict also foreclosed the scope of the competent authorities under the environmental lawforest law stating that their power was limited to scrutiny of a formalised project brought up by an executing agency for ascertaining the environmental impact and imposition of remedial conditions\n\nDrawing a comparison between a highway and an industrial project spread over a vast expanse of area the court believed that the former only gave a way of passage without much disturbance while the latter had an impact on the local population owing to the continuous commercialindustrial activity Therefore according to the court environmental impact would have to be measured in relative terms at the local level and sitespecific Whereas the requirement for a roadnational highway was in the larger national interest rendering environmental clearances perfunctory\n\nWe will not give up our lands\n\nThat being the position landowners want the Centre to drop the project believing that nothing else will bring respite to them Farmers will not give land for the project says R Mohanasundaram a farmer from Pullavari in Salem who claims he will lose six acres to the project It will not get environmental clearance if the assessment is made in a transparent manner he says The Supreme Courts judgment has more or less retained the positive elements of the judgment passed by the Madras High Court It has permitted the Centre to go ahead with the project only after following due procedures he points out\n\nEnvironmental risks\n\nThe State government should now put pressure on the Centre and make it drop the project The project involves destruction of several acres of forests agricultural lands and several waterbodies says Mr Mohanasundaram Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswamis claims about the project are not true If he is a farmer as he claims he should stop the progress of the project at any cost\n\nAccording to official sources nearly 36 km of the project passes through Salem district\n\nJ Pannerselvam of Koolampatti in Salem district says he will lose three acres We are not against development Farmers are only questioning the need for this project when there are already three roads connecting Chennai with Salem besides the rail and air connectivity The road is being laid only to favour corporates Our only demand now is that the governments should drop the project that will affect farmers in 18 villages he adds\n\nThe land acquired for the UlundurpetChennai Highway has space for expansion he says adding that expansion of the existing roads will be sufficient to facilitate freight movement\n\nM Kavitha a farmer from Ayodhiyapattinam who would lose 75 acres wants the government to drop the project We will continue with our protests till the government decides to scrap the project she says\n\nTalk to farmers MP\n\nDMK MP from Salem SR Parthibhan wants the government to hold discussions with farmers instead of taking away their land and depriving them of their livelihood The party will raise the issue during elections and demand that the government drop the project he says DMK MP from Dharmapuri Senthilkumar says his party will scrap the project when it returns to power I am meeting with the farmers on December 16 at Paapireddypatty to hold consultations with them he says\n\nMeanwhile farmers have resolved to stage a blockade of the Collectorate in Dharmapuri on December 28 and observe Pongal as a day of mourning They have also planned a blockade of the State Assembly during the Budget Session in February next year\n\nWith inputs from Vignesh Vijayakumar in Salem and Deepa H Ramakrishnan in Chennai",

to call an officer on deputation and in case of a disagreement its decision prevails However given the federal structure the Centre does not usually insist This matter could well end up in court\n\nHowever keeping in mind the federal structure of the country the Centre rarely uses this order Normally the Centre writes to states every year asking for a list of officers for central deputation Based on the willingness of officers not binding on the state the state governments send an Offer List for central deputation The GoI then decides which officer in the offer list will be posted where This year the Centre wrote to the states on December 7 for the offer list for 2021\n\nThere have been instances of tussles between state governments and the Centre over the deputation of officers in the recent past\n\nTamil Nadu and the Centre had a few years ago sparred over the deputation of state cadre officer Archana Ramasundaram In 2014 the UPA government had called Ramasundaram to the Centre where she was expected to join the CBI as ADG When the state government did not relieve her for three months she reported to the Centre on her own The state government suspended her for going to the Centre without being relieved\n\nThe matter went to the Supreme Court and Ramasundaram retained her central deputation but lost the opportunity to serve in the CBI She was finally appointed Director General of Sashastra Seema Bal becoming the first woman to head a paramilitary force\n\nTop News Right Now\n\nClick here for more\n\nGujarat cadre IPS officer Kuldeep Sharma had similarly fought his way to the Centre in 2012\n\nIn these cases however the officers were willing to serve at the Centre and had figured in the offer list which is not the case in West Bengal now\n\nSources said the matter could reach the courts While the Centre has the right to call officers to GoI even without the states consent the state can argue in court that the Centres decision is mala fide or informed by bias against the state a senior IPS officer said",

                "Summary": "Birthday Postscript\n\nBoth Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar have their birthdays in December While Sonias was a low key celebration Pawars 80th birthday saw half page advertisements in the national dailies felicitating his political journey Interestingly in the essay that accompanies the greetings Praful Patel recounts the many times Pawar nearly became Prime Minister beginning with 1991 when Narasimha Rao was propped up over Pawars candidature and later in 1996 when the Congress won 145 MPs the United Front leaders such as Deve Gowda Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Yadav had agreed to support a Congress government under Pawars prime ministership but Narasimha Rao didnt flinch Later when the Gowda government was brought down by Sitaram Kesri this plan was revived again but didnt get Kesris backing Praful Patel also talks about how later when Sharad Pawar was the Congress parliamentary party leader his decisions were overrun by PJ Kurien at the promptings of Sonia Gandhi And so on Its interesting that this narrative has come to light at a time when the Congress is looking for a credible leadership to replace Sonia Gandhi and is also for the first time questioning the hold of the dynasty In fact the timing of Pranab Mukherjees memoirs where he rues the fact that he was kept from becoming Prime Minister by the Gandhi family is also interesting Will the Congress look to the past to make decisions about the future\n\nPawar Games\n\nLast week saw the revival of an old story when the political rumour mill claimed that Sharad Pawar would replace Sonia Gandhi as the UPA chairperson Certainly with Sonia Gandhi taking a step back Pawar is the tallest leader in the UPA But the NCP is not the largest party and Pawar is well aware of this limitation However there is a certain disquiet amongst the UPA partners as to who will lead the opposition alliance against the BJP Rahul Gandhi doesnt seem to carry much clout not as leader of the Congress and also not as a reliable ally Its not just the partys drubbing in Bihar that pulled down the alliance but Akhilesh Yadav also blames his alliance with the Congress for sabotaging his chances in the 2017 UP polls Mamata Bannerjee is not keen to tie up with the Congress in West Bengal and it remains to be seen what kind of a bargain the DMK will strike with the Congress for the Tamil Nadu polls Interestingly it was Pawar who recently spoke to Rahuls lack of consistency And therefore while the Congress and even the NCP has denied the rumours that Pawar will replace Sonia as the UPA chairperson it hasnt scotched the speculation For as the Shiv Senas Sanjay Raut said on the subject Politics is unpredictable You never know what will happen next While Congress leaders claim that the role of chairperson should be given to a member of the largest party in the coalition they forget two things One that the UPA is not a formal organisation with a hard and fast Constitution but a loose coalition of likeminded parties Second as Rasheed Kidwai author and political commentator points out when the National Front was formed the chairmanship went to NT Ramarao even though the TDP was not the largest party the Janata Party was The real question remains did the NCP overplay its hand by going public with its plans\n\nThe Himalayan Challenge\n\nDr Subramanian Swamys book Himalayan Challenge India China and the Quest for Peace is now out Dr Swamys link with China goes way back and was one of the reasons why he was invited to China in 1981 by then Chairman Deng Xiaoping At the end of a 100minute meeting he persuaded the Chinese to open the Kailash Mansarovar route for Hindu pilgrims This meeting is part of the annexures of Swamys book as are extracts from a Soviet document dated 2nd October 1959 which Swamy accessed from the Woodrow Wilson Cold War Archives while at Harvard The document records a meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong where both Nehru and Tibet come up for discussion between the two leaders But what is interesting is that through this book Swamy takes a look at Indias China policy over the years from Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi Few know this but Swamy is also fluent in Mandarin a language he took up as a challenge from his wife Roxna In fact during a NewsX interview when asked to speak in Mandarin he quoted a Chinese proverb which goes like thisbeware of the foreigner who speaks Chinese as its such a difficult language that those who take the trouble of learning it would definitely have some agenda for doing so As for Swamys agenda he is hopeful for a long term relationship between the two countries which share a common Asian mindset but for now he is of the firm view that we should push back the Chinese from our territory and not be misled by them as we were in 1962\n\nBungalow Politics\n\nThe late Ahmed Patels family has been given a notice by the Rajya Sabha Housing Committee to vacate his bungalow in Delhi albeit with a grace period of six months which the family is grateful for Congress workers all recall Ahmed Bhais house at Mother Teresa Crescent as a house with many doors for despite a waiting room full of visitors you never knew who was entering or exiting the place What Congress leaders however are asking is whether the late Ram Vilas Paswans family too has been served a similar notice Or could it be that Narendra Modis ministerial reshuffle might accommodate Chirag Paswan in more ways than one\n\nWhat next for Kamal Nath\n\nAhmed Patel leaves behind many a vacancy Not just as party treasurer but more importantly what the party will miss is his role as a trouble shooter While Rahul Gandhi would like to prop up someone from his own team there are some who believe that none of them has the expertise and experience of a candidate from the Old Guard\n\nAshok Gehlots name is doing the rounds but the Rajasthan Chief Minister has made it clear that he would rather stay on in the state There is however another ex CM who is out of job and may fit the role of a trouble shooter Kamal Nath for he has a good equation with almost all the UPA alliesfrom Pawar to the DMK as well as others such as Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati In fact as general secretary of the party Nath has handled several crucial states including West Bengal Assam and Tamil Nadu all three which are slated to go to the polls next year In fact the evergreen networker has kept a channel open with all the factions of the party and not just the Old Guard\n\nFor instance Nath was in Jaipur recently for a wedding and while one is not sure whether he met Gehlot it was Sachin Pilot who came to see him off at the airport So Nath may have the right credentials for the job there is also an opening in his CV that coincides with a vacancy at the party headquarters But will he get the job The answer to this question is not with Sonia Gandhi but with Rahul",

                "Summary": "During the special meeting of the National Green Tribunal NGT nominated Permanent Committee to discuss the stray dogs menace at IITMadras IITM campus Padma Shri Dr Ashok Jhunjhunwala a professor at the institute representing the concerns of the professors staying inside the campus said that stray dogs were adversely affecting the reputation of the institute both nationally and globally\n\nIn the meeting held on December 3 Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala mentioned that visiting faculty and students from foreign countries had expressed serious concerns over the dog menace adversely affecting the reputation of the institute which is ranked number 1 in the country thereby indirectly affection the reputation of the nation too\n\nIIT Madras has been granted the position of Institute of Eminence and it is expected that more number of foreign faculty and students will visit and stay on campus in the coming years If this dog menace continues it will give us negative feedback among the foreign faculty and students It will severely affect our institute reputation among world class institutions Prof Jhunjhunwala said in the meeting He also urged the committee and the NGT to consider these aspects while taking any decision regarding the stray dog menace in the campus\n\nProf Jhunjhunwala said that he himself was intimidated by packs of ferocious stray dogs many times inside the campus and that most of the time he could not step out of the car for fear of getting chased and bitten\n\nHe said that as a resident who had lived in the campus for 40 years the stray dog menace has gotten severe in the past 23 years mainly due to the sudden increase in the number of stray dogs that have been let loose in the campus\n\nRecently the Chennai Wildlife Warden CH Padma who is also part of the committee constituted by the NGT has increased the number of feeding centres inside the campus for stray dogs to from 5 14 after pressure from doglover groups in the campus She had also permitted feeding of homecooked food\n\nProf Jhunjhunwala mentioned that a survey conducted among 400 faculty members living in the campus on the opinion of increasing feeding locations resulted in 98 of them vehemently being against the move He said that residents were furious about the increase in feeding centres adding that neither people travelling in two wheelers could travel in peace nor children could play outside as rabid dogs chase them\n\nHe also highlighted the endless attacks by the feral dogs on the deers and blackbucks which has drastically reduced their population\n\nDr Jhunjhunwala also submitted a number of recommendations asking the number of freeranging dogs to be kept at a number that does not disrupt the academic life in the campus including sterilization electronically tagging the dogs caging the feral dog pack leaders and restricting the feeding points to 34 locations However any attempt to remove the stray dogs and bring in regulations to protect the endangered species is being obstructed by doglover groups in the campus and animal activists who try to engage NGOs run by them or their known circles to take care of these rabid stray dogs The NGO that has been engaged in IITMadras to take care of these dogs is Jeeva Karunya Animal Welfare Trust run by Shoba Chellathurai and Joe Prakash Jacob\n\nThere have been allegations that the incumbent Registrar of the institution Dr Jane Prasad has been favouring Christians primarily those from the Nagercoil district in appointments She is said to have brought Jeeva Karunya Animal Welfare Trust of Nagercoil for feeding sterilization and microchipping of the stray dogs\n\nOn the other hand selfproclaimed animal activist Antony Clement Rubin has challenged Dr Jhunjhunwalas appeal to the NGT nominated Permanent Committee He has been advocating the institute to spend money out of its coffers to set up dog parks dog clinicsdog feeding spots He has presented with an action plan on how to save deers from stray dogs It is to be noted that Anthony Clement Rubin an antiJallikattu campaigner has been going after several temple elephants in Tamil Nadu and trying to oust them from the temples to be sent to elephant camps run by the government\n\nAntony Clement Rubin who works for Chinny Krishna and Menka Gandhi have challenged this in NGT They are advocating the Institute to spend money and take care of the dogs they have devised a plan with the new Evangelical gang of contracted care takers and wasting tax pictwittercomGJe0VQdsUc  Indu Makkal Katchi  இந்த மக்கள் கட்ச  Off  Indumakalktchi December 11 2020\n\nIndu Makkal Katchi IMK the only political party in Tamil Nadu which has been voicing out against the rampant stray dog menace at IITM has been calling for protecting the deers blackbuck and native wildlife species in the campus\n\nSpeaking to The Commune Mr Sathyanarayanan spokesperson of the IMK said even a child knows that the only way to save wildlife in the campus is to remove stray dogs that have invaded the reserved forest area and not provide them shelters\n\nS Muralidharan a Chennai based animal activist told The Commune that it is outrageous that a reserve forest is being used as a feeding and breeding ground for stray dogs We all love dogs and there are a plenty of them on the streets But to bring them into a reserve forest feed them mindlessly which later goes on to kill native wildlife in the forest is just ridiculous Mr Muralidharan said",

                "Summary": " Provided by News18 Bidens Challenge Building Cabinet That Meets All His Goals\n\nWASHINGTON Shortly after Presidentelect Joe Bidens victory last month Cabinet hopeful Marcia Fudge pointedly noted that Black people are often typecast into positions such as housing secretary On Friday Biden announced Fudge a prominent Black congresswoman from Ohio was his nominee for that very role She was introduced alongside Bidens pick for the job she initially sought head of the Agriculture Department That went instead to Tom Vilsack a 70yearold white man who already spent eight years in the position during the Obama administration Those nominations highlight the competing priorities Biden is facing as he fills out the top ranks of his administration Hes pledged to nominate the most diverse Cabinet in history and restore experience at beleaguered federal agencies Hes seeking to reward loyalists who have stood with him throughout his lengthy career and give opportunities to new voices in the Democratic Party Each of his nominees has to win confirmation in a narrowly divided Senate that could be controlled by Republicans depending on who wins two runoff races in Georgia next month The GOP has barely acknowledged Bidens victory so the cooperation of its senators in the confirmation process is far from certain Theres a lot of pressure and part of the reason you saw such big turnout is that people are eager for change from the Trump years said Democratic strategist Karen Finney That creates a lot of high expectations The challenge wont get easier Biden is facing a decision on attorney general that will come under intense scrutiny from Black leaders who want someone with a background in civil rights advocacy and Republicans who are demanding political independence as Bidens son Hunter faces a federal investigation into his finances Some of those tensions emerged last week during a meeting between Biden and civil rights leaders who pressed the incoming president to diversify his Cabinet and warned about the Vilsack pick in particular Vilsack has been criticized for the firing of department official Shirley Sherrod who is Black during his last stint at the USDA a move he later apologized for NAACP President Derrick Johnson warned Biden that the Vilsack selection could hurt Black turnout in the critical Georgia contests Vilsack could have a disastrous effect on voters in the state of Georgia NAACP President Derrick Johnson told Biden during the meeting which was private Audio was leaked to The Intercept which released excerpts Biden bristled at such concern saying Lets get something straight you shouldnt be upset What Ive done so far is more than what anyone else has done this far he added I mean what I say The presidentelect has several more Cabinet posts to fill and has made history with some of his early selections He nominated retired Army Gen Lloyd Austin to be the first Black person to lead the Pentagon while picking California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be the first Latino to lead the Health and Human Services Department His nominee for US trade envoy Katherine Tai was born in Connecticut to Taiwanese parents But those choices were announced after African Americans Latinos and Asian Americans in Congress voiced concerns that their perspectives may not be fully represented in the new administration Some nominees will face other hurdles most notably Austin who needs a waiver to fill the civilian role leading the Pentagon Thats a step some Democrats have historically opposed Biden could further diversify his Cabinet by picking Rep Deb Haaland of New Mexico as the first Native American interior secretary giving her authority over a powerful agency that oversees the nations tribes But doing so would further erode the razor thin Democratic majority in the House something Biden can ill afford considering the partys tenuous standing in the Senate Theres particular frustration that until Tais nomination there was no one of Asian descent in a Cabinetlevel secretary position California Rep Judy Chu the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus said she suggested senior roles for Asian Americans during the campaign and transition only for action to come at the last minute We tried to work collaboratively during the campaign Chu said Thats why we are worried One prominent feature of Bidens picks so far deep ties to the Obama administration That includes exWhite House chief of staff Denis McDonough as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs and former UN ambassador and national security adviser Susan Rice as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council Bidens team has said long government experience is paramount at a time when the country is facing a historic pandemic and economic uncertainty But other Democrats are urging him to blend those familiar faces with newer voices We have some people whove been in the Cabinet before  theres a role for those people especially in a crisis like this they have the knowledge  but its important to be adding voices and lifting up the next generation of leaders said Rep Katie Porter DCalif Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez DNY also voiced concern that there was no cohesive vision emerging from Bidens slate of advisers We can wrestle about whether they are bold enough or ambitious enough especially given the uncertainty and what kind of Senate were going to have OcasioCortez said But aside from that I think one of the things Im looking for when I see all of these picks together is What is the agenda What is the overall vision going to be After a largely centrist primary bid won him the Democratic presidential nomination Biden sought to incorporate more progressive priorities into his general election campaign promising to invest billions in new green jobs and make major improvements to infrastructure to battle climate change But some progressive leaders including Sens Elizabeth Warren DMass and Bernie Sanders IVt seem unlikely to land in the Cabinet given the transition teams concerns about poaching from Democrats ranks in the Senate Thats left some activists worried that the administration wont live up to its campaign promises to the partys left flank I think there are some red flags or in this case some discouraging blue flags said Norman Solomon national director of the progressive activist group RootsAction Solomon said progressive groups are prepared to organize to try and block the nomination of Bidens pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget IndianAmerican Neera Tanden because of her past antagonism toward Sanders They also oppose many of Bidens picks from the Democratic establishment including incoming senior adviser Cedric Richmond a Louisiana congressman with close ties to oil and gas companies active in his energyrich district Brent Colburn a former Obama administration official who served in several agencies encouraged Democrats to consider the bigger picture as they judge Bidens Cabinet What will ultimately impact the success of the Biden presidency is his ability to build a team that is qualified tested and that he is comfortable taking advice and counsel from Colburn said You have to assess these picks in context of the long game ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta

Day by demanding the release of all rights activists and intellectuals who are lodged in prison\n\nThe event at Delhis Tikri border marked the farmer movements broadening with farmers union leaders asking for the release of political prisoners or academics lawyers and activists held under oppressive laws over dubious charges\n\nA section of mainstream media had been quick to brand the demand a hijacking of the farmers movement by Leftist intellectuals The following statement released by the BKU Ugrahan offers an idea as to why the protesters decided to add another cause to their agenda\n\n\n\nThe intellectuals whose release we are demanding are those who have stood firm against the oppressive and communal attacks waged by the Modi government on Indian society They have made huge sacrifices and are now braving a life in prison but they have never shied away from their duty to speak truth to power and communicate this truth to the people\n\nWith their pen art and speech they have exposed the communal and pro corporate agendas of the BJP government They have raised their voice in support of the Adivasis whose rights have been violated by the government just so as to facilitate the greed of the corporate and business class\n\nActivists like Stan Swamy have spent their lives in the forests of Jharkhand Intellectuals like Sudha Bhardwaj have dedicated all their knowledge and educational qualification for the upliftment of poor workers They have given up every kind of comfort and luxury and made the service of workers their mission\n\nTheir only fault is that they have stood firm against the procorporate policies of antipeople governments They have played a critical role in creating awareness organizing and mobilising those who are being oppressed  the people of Kashmir women Dalits adivasis and all others who are oppressed and marginalised in our country\n\nCompanies like Vedanta could not deter their resolve with all their dollars And this is why they have become targets of false allegations Sometimes they are labelled urban Naxals sometimes antinational and sometimes they have been called the tukde tukde gang We must remember that such allegations have been levelled against not only these intellectuals and activists but also so many innocent young men and women among all these oppressed and marginalised sections This includes people whose families were first targeted during communal violence in Delhi and later they themselves were accused of that very violence and thrown in jails under draconian laws\n\nAs such is it not our duty that we speak up for and embolden the voice of these warriors of truth We have not raised our voice for them for the first time We have been voicing our concerns ever since emergencylike provisions were being created during the COVID19 pandemic lockdown The demand for the release of the intellectuals and activists has been put forth right from the beginning of our current struggle\n\nTheir photographs have been put up across sites of dharnas and protests in Punjab The demand is also included in the charter of demands that we put in front of the Central government Not only has this been included in our organisations list of demands it has also been raised by the platform of 30 kisan organisations The entire democratic movement in Punjab has been raising the demand for their release ever since they have been targeted by the government By resisting and opposing the poisonous communal propaganda of the Modi government in the past 6 years Punjab has been a beacon of hope for the entire country\n\nFor people of Punjab targeting these intellectuals and activists is akin to targeting prominent journalists like Charanjit Bhullar and Davinderpal and activists like Professor Jagmohan Singh nephew of Shaheed Bhagat Singh in order to silence people speaking for human rights The state wants to ensure that nobody takes up cases of human rights activists in the courts It would be like putting theatre activists performing in villages to make people aware of their rights in jail It would be like putting late theatre artist Gursharan Singh in jail for his acts of resistance against state repression\n\nAlso read A List of Activists Scholars and Scribes Whose Personal Liberty Remains at Judiciarys Mercy\n\nSocially engaged intellectuals have informed the farmers about the reality of farm laws They have exposed the true character of the laws touted as welfare measures These people have been targeted by the ruling class and hence are implicated in false cases Raising out voice for these propeople activists mean raising our voice for the people It also means enabling them to continue with the important work of exposing antipeople policies of the state Mobilising support for these activists means strengthening these voices and being on the side of justice\n\nViolation of human rights in rampant in our society We have consistently raised our voice against such violations We unconditionally stand for human rights of workers from all the castes religions races regions and languages We do not speak for any specific section of the society We support all ideological struggles against communal politics We are strongly against those who violate the laws of the land which ensure freedom of speech and expression to everyone\n\nThe people put in jails became target of the state as they exercised their right to free speech On the occasion of International Human Rights Day it is important that we raise our voice in their support We have fulfilled our duty by raising our voice in their favour and we will keep on doing so It will be wrong to associate this demand of ours with any religion caste colour or region\n\nBJP has resorted to the policy of divide and rule which people need to be aware of They dub anyone who raises the voice for rights of people as a traitor It is their tested formula to defame peoples voices as seditious or insinuate that they are coloured by a specific religion or ideology They dub dissenting voices as Naxalites or Pakistan sponsored terrorists We should be conscious about the troll armies managed by their partys

                "Summary": "Pleased that Indian audiences will finally get to watch Nirvana Inn as it gets set for its World Digital Premiere on Cinemapreneur on December 11 filmmaker Vijay Jayapal whose Hindilanguage psychological horror drama starring Adil Hussain Rajshri Deshpande and Sandhya Mridul had its World Premiere at the prestigious 24th Busan International Film festival in 2019 says It has travelled multiple festivals across the world However due to the pandemic we could not show it here Although I will miss the physical screening but it is great that Indian audiences will finally get to watch it\n\nThe film which was shot in Manali Majuli and Chennai follows the story of a boatman who becomes the caretaker of a Himalayan resort after an attempted suicide\n\nThe idea for this film came to Jayapal after he read a news report about a suicidal commercial airlines pilot who crashed the jet with passengers aboard\n\nI stumbled upon that piece around six years back and it never left me When I wrote the film it was supposed to be in Tamil and Malayalam says the director whose debut film Revelations was also premiered at Busan\n\nBut once he was convinced that Adil Hussain should play the lead he decided to make the movie in Hindi\n\nI am a big fan of his work This movie needed a certain kind of performance  at the core it is a very dramatic story but the treatment had to be very subtle and performance understated The entire story hinges on the protagonist I wanted an actor who would bring that subtlety and intensity The first name that came to mind was that of Adil Hussain That is when it became a Hindi film In fact he had already watched my previous film something that prompted him to read the script says Jayapal\n\nTalking about the digital premiere on Cinemapreneur the director feels that considering the fact that cinemas are not completely functional and several mainstream films are now premiering in OTT platforms it made much sense to show it on the said platform During the lockdown traditional mainstream films suddenly started penetrating in the OTT space something that has created a certain imbalance for independent films which for the last five years have been dependent on such OTT platforms\n\nThings have never been easy for independent cinema but with the pandemic they have become worse We will have to innovate and find new ways to reach out to the audience\n\nLamenting the fact that major film festivals were cancelled this year owing to Covid19 and one does not really know if they would be held in 2021 too Jayapal says Yes festivalgoers are quite disappointed For independent filmmakers too these festivals are very important not just for screening but also meeting others from the fraternity watching movies by other directors and masterclasses etc\n\nOptimistic that in the post Covid world too digital would continue to be an important tool for filmmakers like him he adds It is the way forward Even before the pandemic the worlds dynamic of watching films was changing thanks to OTT platforms The bigger films were going to theatres while smaller ones were being consumed by the digital space And I have always believed that in a country like India there is an audience for every kind of film Therefore people are bound to stay connected with digital for independent films even when things come back to normal\n\nStressing that the critical acclaim enjoyed by his debut film helped get producers for Nirvana Inn the filmmaker says  Revelations was the film that gave me an identity The producers for my latest one are all firsttimers In fact the lead one messaged me after seeing my first film on a digital platform\n\nJayapal who has been writing for the past eight months says he is ready with many new scrips Ill start pitching them in 2021 though I am yet to decide the one which I would like to make first\n\nIANS\n\nsukantsdr",

                "Summary": "A feature of Dravidian politics since the 50s is the extraordinary influence that movies and film stars wield Even though other states have elected movie stars to power the consistent stream of movie stars that articulate and follow through on political ambitions is a unique feature of Tamil Nadu and their coastal cousins to the North the Telugus\n\nThis was not so at its inception In fact the earlier avatar of the Dravidian movement the Justice Party were upperclass social conservatives who looked down upon entertainers and the industry as infra dig\n\nThat same conservatism was reflected in Periyar EV Ramasamys attitude towards the movie industry people that formed the propaganda arm of the DMK He frequently called them koothadis  a Tamil term that can only be translated into Hindi as nachaniya\n\nHow did movies and actors become so closely intertwined with the politics of the State To understand that we must take a little tour across time and space that begins with Europe of the 30s\n\nMovies as mass propaganda\n\nThe November 1932 German federal election was a disappointment to the Nazi Party which lost 34 seats 4 of vote share and could not form a Government on its own After talks with Gregor Strasser to form a coalition with a breakaway faction of the Nazis failed Chancellor Strasser made a deal to form a coalition with Adolf Hitler as Chancellor In endFebruary the Reichstag was set fire by arsonists and snap elections were announced within days The Nazi stormtroopers by now ruled the streets and were able to steal the elections by massive violence against Communists CentreRight Conservatives and the Social Democratic Party\n\nThis was an experience that Hitler was determined never to repeat He and the Nazi Party then hit upon the formula of using the emerging medium of movies as a tool of propaganda It was at the same time that a brilliant young woman called Leni Riefensthal began to make movies\n\nThe Nazis won the popular vote and formed the Government in March 1933 Within weeks Hitler passed an act giving himself dictatorial powers and also banned all other parties\n\nIn August and September the Nazis began the first of their grand rallies in Nuremberg Rather than simple party conferences these were brilliantly choreographed spectacles modelled on the pomp and pageantry of ancient Rome Leni had a full reign of affairs and made a movie Der Sieg des Glaubens  The Victory of Faith  which showed the party conference and took great pains in highlighting the leaders of the movement as heroic figures\n\nShe followed it up with the classic Triumph des Willens which was a record of the 1935 Nuremberg Rally The intricate choreography and the combination of heroic themes from Wagner and the camera shots turned the Fuhrer Hitler into something of a mythic figure\n\nOther Powers were quick to take note Hollywood followed up with highquality war propaganda films in the 40s The Soviets also took note The Soviet propaganda news reels of the Second World War and the postWar eulogizing of Stalin were impressive in their effectiveness\n\nTamil Movies as Propaganda\n\nTamil talkies began to be produced in the 1930s There were several factors that shaped the industry in its early years  the usage of actors scripts themes and directors from the stage industry and the taste of the general public In order to dodge criticisms of being entertainment of poor virtue these movies mostly had Puranic themes A few social movies were made but due to heavy censorship political themes were few and far between\n\nInto this environment a young man from a Vishwakarma goldsmith family Mayavaram Krishnamurthy Thiyagarajan stepped in with a movie called Pavalakkodi in 1934 His singing voice and suave looks made him the first Tamil superstar Between PU Chinnappa T R Mahalingam and M K Radha it was MKT or Thyagaraja Bhagavatar as he was known by then who stood head and shoulders above the rest\n\nAt the same time N S Krishnan was a comedic genius and the first comic star of Tamil movies With his wife T A Mathuram they made a comic pair that worked very successfully He himself made a few films that were spoofs of ancient Puranic stories and folklore In one of his movies Chandrahari a reversal of the name Harishchandra he played a king who refused to speak a single word of truth These films were quite successful and there was a mild element of lampooning Hindu beliefs and an undercurrent of antiBrahminism in his films\n\nTowards the beginning of the war many of the senior artists in the movie industry were influenced by Congress principles and the freedom movement K B Sundarambal MS Subbulakshmi were among the leading nationalist stars They sang about Gandhi ji Prohibition homespun khadar the charka and acted in nationalist themed films that spoke for widow remarriage against untouchability and so on These social themes were the platform for the Congress brand of nationalism and thus drew people into the nationalist cause\n\nMS Subbulakshmis husband Kalki Sadasivam was a Congressman and between him the leading producers K Subramanyam and SS Vasan the movie business was influenced with a nationalistic fervour as yet unseen elsewhere in India\n\nSeva Sadanam Thyaga Bhoomi were blockbusters Thyaga Bhoomi 1939 had visuals of Gandhi ji spinning the charka and Congress volunteers courting arrest\n\nThe Justice Party had banned a few nationalist movies when it was in power but once the Congress took power in Madras Presidency in 1937 there was little hindrance from the authorities as long as no direct negative references were made to the Crown or the British Clearly the Congress and the nationalist movement were winning at this propaganda game\n\nThe Muckraker\n\nC N Lakshmikanthan was an exconvict who had completed a 7year sentence in 1939 He started a magazine called Cine Thoothu Cine Courier It had to be shut down on orders for poor quality journalism in the form of unverified rumours He started Hindu Nesan Hindu Nationalist which was in the same mould His stockintrade was gossip about prominent people in society mostly related to their sex lives The identity of people was very thinly veiled and put in a way that it would be unmistakable He made a living by blackmailing people to stop publication of their stories in his magazine\n\nLakshmikanthan was an exconvict with good contacts among the roughnecks of Madras of the day He just shrugged off the threats and in one instance himself beat up the thug who had been sent to threaten him\n\nIn 1944 he was stabbed by a group of men in the evening and succumbed to injuries the next day\n\nJail\n\nBoth Thyagaraja Bhagavatar and NS Krishnan were among the accused They were convicted and sentenced to jail on counts of conspiracy to murder The two appealed in the Privy Council in London which referred the case back to the Madras High Court By the time the appeal was heard and acquittal issued 30 months had passed by and the year was 1947 India got Independence a few months later AVM Studios movie Naam Iruvar came out which was probably the last nationalistCongress themed movie for a while\n\nDravidian movies\n\nAfter their release MKT and NSKs careers and lives took different trajectories but still continued with themes of loss and difficulties\n\nMKT tried producing movies for himself but he continued with the old Puranic themes He continued to be avowedly apolitical and refused to renounce or hide his faith in the Gods and in the Hindu religion He was shunned by the music sabhas and his movies didnt do well After his release he only made 4 films none of which did well before his death in 1959\n\nNSK however made a comeback and got roles as a comedian in movies He home production Nallathambi of 1949 introduced C N Annadurai as the script writer\n\nRandor Guy the Tamil movie historian recounts in his 1997 book Starlight Starbright that popular opinion held that both the major stars implicated in the case were innocent and had been framed He also says that when he tried to investigate this in the 1970s he was politely warned to stay off the story\n\nThe same year that he made his debut in the movies Annadurai broke away from the parent Dravidar Kazhagam to form the political outfit Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam which till date is the primary electoral and political vehicle of the Dravidian movement Nallathambi released in February and the DMK was formed in September\n\nAnother young member of the DMK M Karunanidhi began his career as a staff scriptwriter in 1946 in Coimbatores Jupiter Pictures His breakout hit Manthirikumari in 1950 also was the breakout movie for a young actor called M G Ramachandran\n\nRamachandran who was a khadarwearing Congressman came under the influence of Annadurai and joined the DMK in 1953\n\nKarunanidhis major hit with dialogues 1952s Parasakthi also launched the other Tamil super star of the 60s Sivaji Ganesan\n\nSivaji managed to balance his religious faith with the careerboosting atheismthemed movies for some time However his popularity and his refusal to toe the party line made him a target A smear campaign was run against him when he visited the temple at Tirupati He broke away from the Dravidian movement then\n\nStrangely the Congress in Tamil Nadu never thought much of using the medium of cinema to the same extent that the DMK did\n\nFrom 1967 onwards until the death of Jayalalitha in 2016 for 49 years the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was always someone from the film industry or their proxy\n\nThe impact\n\nThe impact of this case was far reaching The dominance of Dravidian ideology would have taken a much longer time since the popularity of Thyagaraja Bhagavatar was at its peak His last film before he was jailed  Bhakta Haridas  had the distinction of staying in theatres for three Deepavalis\n\nThe sudden exit of these two stalwarts and the full cooption of NS Krishnan gave the Dravidian movement its springboard into the Tamil movie industry\n\nHispanic Popular Culture in the Americas\n\nSuch cultural mass extinction events have happened twice elsewhere  in the Mexican film industry and the plane crash that claimed the lives of Buddy Holly Richie Valens and JP Richardson which slowed down the commercial success of Spanish language rock and roll\n\nThe Mexican film industry went through a very successful period in the 1940s There was a possibility of the industry going on to dominate the Spanish speaking world which at that time was close to the Englishspeaking audience in numbers though not in revenue\n\nIn 1953 the star Jorge Negrete died of cirrhosis after a trip to Los Angeles at the age of 49 His contemporary Pedro Infante died in a plane crash at the age of 40 in 1957 Their successor Javier Solis died at 35 in 1966\n\nBetween these deaths the entry of television in the 1950s and lack of funds sent the industry into a long period of decline from the 1960s to 1990s During the same period English language films went on to attract the best funds technology and auteurs and dominate the cultural landscape of the world\n\nThe postWorld War II Baby Boomer generation of America was the first that made popular music a cultural commodity that could drive attitudes trends and viewpoints Before this generation came of age in the 1950s the foundation for the popular music of the next few decades were being laid in rockandroll acts White American artistes took the tunes and chords of black blues and soul music and creating the new popular sound\n\nA 16yearold Hispanic artiste  Richie Valens  made a dramatic entry in 1957 His 1958 hit single La Bamba was one of the earliest Spanishlanguage rockandroll numbers that made it to the Billboard charts An Americawide Spanishlanguage rockandroll market remained still born after Ritchie Valens died in a plane crash in 1959 in which the other stars of the era  Buddy Holly and JP Richardson  also died\n\nTo this day Spanish language music and Spanish movies continue to play second fiddle to English movies and music acts\n\nIn the same way after the removal of the major stars Tamil movies took a direction that has not changed to this day",

                "Summary": "Not all the state associations seem to be happy with the venues chosen for Englands upcoming tour of India and some aggrieved cricket administrators in the state associations are linking it to this months elections of the Indian cricket board Even Indian cricket board president Sourav Gangulys home state Bengal has questioned him on why it wasnt allotted any of the 12 matches that will be played in FebruaryMarch\n\nA shocked Mumbai said it was extremely unexpected at being ignored completely On the other hand Gujarat Cricket Association GCA will host seven of the 12 matches in Ahmedabad\n\nPune a very surprising choice will host all three Oneday Internationals while Chennai  Tamil Nadu Cricket Associations president Rupa Meiyappan is the daughter of former BCCI Board of Control for Cricket in India chief N Srinivasan  will host two of the four Tests The other two Tests will be staged in Ahmedabad along with all the five T20 Internationals The GCA which will host a an unprecedented seven matches is the home association of BCCI secretary Jay Shah though he doesnt hold any position in it now\n\nThe Mumbai Cricket Association MCA is the other affiliate of the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI that is shocked to find the city being ignored for the February 5March 28 tour of England especially as no Test has been staged in the city for four years\n\nInterestingly Ganguly had hinted on September 28 that Mumbai and Kolkata could host the England matches though at the time there were still some doubts about the tour materialising due to the Covid pandemic But it was certain that if the tour went ahead matches would be played in a biosecure bubble either in India or in the United Arab Emirates UAE as the BCCI has signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU with the Emirates Cricket Board ECB for cooperation\n\nWhile Cricket Association Bengal CAB president Avishek Dalmiya said he has asked Ganguly directly MCA executive committee member Nadeem Memon speaking on behalf of panel colleagues has requested MCA president Vijay Patil to let them know the reasons for Mumbai not getting a single match\n\nMemon also referred to Gangulys comments on September 28 Ganguly a former CAB president had made those comments soon after signing the MoU with the ECB\n\nWe also have the same facility biosecure bubble in Mumbai  Cricket Club of India Brabourne Stadium Wankhede Stadium and DY Patil Stadium We also have Eden Gardens Kolkata We have to create a bubble We want to hold our cricket in India thats where the game is thats where the heart is Ganguly had said Now there is heartburn in certain pockets of the country\n\nDalmiya son of late Jagmohan Dalmiya and a friend of Ganguly told him that CAB was expecting to hold a match in Kolkata\n\nCAB was expecting a match against England especially since the last ODI match which was scheduled to be played in Kolkata got cancelled said Dalmiya in a statement referring to the ODI against South Africa in March that was cancelled to Covid\n\nIn this context I did have a word with the BCCI president Mr Sourav Ganguly and enquired if Kolkata could be accommodated to which Mr Ganguly informed that these are unprecedented times and that BCCI had to settle with a maximum of three venues this time due to ongoing pandemic he said\n\nDalmiya said that Ganguly has assured me that CAB would get a turn in the next home series\n\nIndia is scheduled to host ODIs and T20s against South Africa as well as T20 matches against New Zealand as per the revised Future Tour Programme postCovid ahead of ICC World T20 in 2021 in India he said\n\nMemon pointed out that Mumbai last hosted a Test match four years ago against England\n\nMumbai has three of the best stadiums in the world with the best hotel facilities and other services Also Mumbai has been recovering well from all Covid19 related crisis Mumbai has not hosted a Test Match since 2016 he said in his letter sent to MCA president Vijay Patil\n\nIt is shocking and extremely unexpected that the BCCI wouldnt consider Mumbai for the upcoming series despite BCCI president Mr Sourav Ganguly himself saying that BCCI will keep the matches in Mumbai in the future he wrote\n\nWe the Apex Council members of the MCA urge you to write to the BCCI president regarding our concern and we want to know the reasons behind them not considering any of the Mumbai stadiums\n\nBesides Dalmiya and Memon several other people linked the choice of Pune  the headquarters of the controversial Maharashtra Cricket Association MCA  to the BCCI elections that would take place on December 24 during the AGM\n\nWhile pointing out that each vote is priceless in a BCCI election an official referred to the crucial financial issues that MCA is in also visavis its International Stadium in Gahunje on the outskirts of Pune where the three ODIs against England will be played\n\nThe equation is very simple MCA has two big financial payments to make and for that it badly and urgently needs money One large payment is due to Shapoorji Pallonji  Co Ltd who constructed the Gahunje stadium and the other is due to Bank of Maharashtra and Andhra Bank from which it has taken a big loans besides Bank of Baroda and Karnataka Bank he said\n\nBy hosting three matches against England MCA would earn a handsome amount

abolished\n\nThis affected Suvendu the most it signalled his work in the Jangalmahal was over and he must stay confined to his constituency\n\nOther slights followed\n\nA cyclone hit Bengal earlier this year East Midnapore was badly hit but rehabilitation was the slowest there and the focus was in South 24 Parganas\n\nAfter Covid19 spread in Bengal the CM interacted and drew up plans with every minister except Suvendu\n\nAfter Durga Puja it seemed the differences were irreconcilable Posters came up all over Suvendus constituency at programmes he sponsored They said Dadar anugami follower of Dada\n\nOfficially Suvendu denied all knowledge But there were no TMC banner or picture of Mamata at these meetings\n\nIn the meantime sensing he was on the brink TMC leaders travelled to Nandigram and held a meeting wher e he was dubbed Mir Jaffer\n\nEfforts are now on at reconciliation But Suvendu will not be able to accept the leadership of Abhishek which is what it all boils down to\n\nHis defection to the BJP could be a gamechanger in Bengal politics",

                "Summary": "In November alone the Allahabad High Court issued orders providing relief to couples in more than 125 cases web journal livelawin reported on Dec1 They were involved in intercaste and interfaith marriages But UPs CM his colleagues in power and UP police have no fear indeedthey uphold rabid hindutva\n\nPM Narendra Modi quoted Subramanya Bharathi Tamilnadus great poet in his address at International Bharati Festival 2020 11 December 2020 His collected works have been published in 16 volumes in 39 years he wrote so much in so diverse forms said Modi Bharati also had a close link with Varanasi his constituency Modis lofty words need to be contextualized\n\nTamilians must be happy as Modi quotes Bharati He is found in recent years quoting often Tamil lines even from Tirukkural But they must be wary too Now Modi and BJP want to bring Tamilnadu closer  as elections there are nearing due in May next \n\n Mahakavi Bharathiyars definition of progress had a central role for women  One of the most important vision was that of independent and empowered women Bharatiyaar wrote that women should walk with their head held high while looking people in the eye said Modi Today over 15 crore women entrepreneurs are funded by schemes like MUDRA Yojana They are walking with their head held high looking us in the eye and telling us how they are becoming selfreliant\n\nToday women are becoming part of our armed forces with permanent commissioning They are walking with their head held high and looking us in the eye and filling us with confidence that the country is in safe hands Modi said of Modi and Shah \n\nEnterprise and boldness of women which Modi praised did not perhaps should not include personal lives nor choice in marriage And Yogi Adityanath appears to emulate Modis quote Fear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me He led and at least 8 states all BJP ruled are engaged in legislating against love jihad He issued an ordinance for the purpose and within days action began\n\nIn UP an interfaith couple engaged for marriage were recently picked up in Lucknow on December 2 at the marriage site by police based on the new law soon after the law was made They were midway through a preparations of a hindu marriage It was by consent mutual as well as by parents They were held and stopped upon a complaint made by Hindu Yuva Vahini not anyone related to the couple as required by even by the lawless UP law\n\nTrouble was the Hinduborn Lucknow bride aged 22 from UP looked into the eyes of a muslim man aged 24 She believed in UPs Allahabad High Court orders which very recently said the state should not interfere in such matters of marital choiceBut Rule of Law as practised nowadays led the couple into police station They must get prior approval of the district Magistrate to get into such marriage which may involve religious conversion they were officially told even as they insisted it was a union by mutual consent\n\nThe above was not an isolated incident Next day in Aligarh court premises another couple who came to register their marriage were stopped Times of India Dec 4 reported The Muslim young man aged 21 was thrashed and taken to an Aligarh police station The girl was whisked away by women police even as she shouted she aged 21 was not a minor and they were marrying by mutual consent\n\nIn November alone the Allahabad High Court issued orders providing relief to couples in more than 125 cases web journal livelawin reported on Dec1 They were involved in intercaste and interfaith marriages\n\nFear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me believes Yogi Adityanath CM of UP emulating Modi He does not fear Courts too Nor do UP police fear courts even High Court\n\nFormer IPS officer NC Asthana had said   The UP law is teeming with blunders that strongly indicate the real intent of the law is to harass people so much that conversion per se is discouraged Incidentally this Lucknow marriage did not involve conversion The Muslim groom was following Hindu rituals of marriage\n\nMembers of several Hindu outfits vandalized Quila police station in Bareilly town UP IANS reported Oct 21 as the police failed to trace a girl who allegedly eloped with a boy She claimed she was a major married by mutual consent there was no complaint of coercion and asked police not to harass the family of the boy of a different community DIG and ADG of police rushed with additional forces and saved the situation There was no love jihad issue the ADG said The Hindutva vigilants may not know Modis quote but had no fear emboldened by the Yogi\n\nSubramanian swamy of the Sangh parivar and a BJP leader pointed out Congress govt of Himachal in 2010 passed a similar law and it was upheld by HP High Court Last year when Himachal passed a more draconian Bill it was unanimously passed Congress too cooperated pointed out Swaminathan Aiyar Times of India Dec 6 2020 who desired the Court must strike down all such laws Modi and Rahul Gandhi speak lofty things while their state units shift the polity to the Right Keralas congress unit did a similar thing in relation to Sabarimalas restrictions on women\n\nWith Modi and Amit Shah at the helm aided by Tamil some leaders and film stars a woman included Tamil nadu is being drawn nearer Fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me believes PMKs Dr Ramdas who has launched his own version of love jihad he openly campaigns against vanniyar community girls marriages with dalit men PMK despite such chauvinism in action had no trouble in allying with Periyarist self respect parties DMK and AIADMK and throughout them with both UPA and NDA\n\nI begin by paying tributes to the great Bharathiyar on his Jayanti Bharathiyar believed in a healthy mix between the ancient and the modernHe considered Tamil Language and motherland India as his two eyes He sang the greatness of the Vedas and Upanishads our culture tradition and our glorious past But at the same time he also warned us that simply living in the past glory is not enough\n\nYes healthy mix for Modis India between the ancient and the modern means combining Chanakya and Machiavelli sedition and UAPA laws\n\nMahakavi Bharatiyaar understood that any society which is divided will not be able to succeed At the same time he wrote about the emptiness of political freedom which does not address the social inequities and does not address social ills We need to develop a scientific temper a spirit of enquiry and march towards progress\n\nany society which is divided will not be able to succeed But it is found that BJP will succeed with every kind of division between not only religious communities and castes  but also between sunnis and shias and between subcastes Modis speech extracts are based on PMOPIB Text \n\nOnly the day before December 10 2020 scientific temper a spirit of enquiry was displayed in another function addressed by Modi and that spirit can be seen in the photo below\n\nSpeaking at the foundationlaying ceremony of new Parliament building the Prime Minister said that inauguration of the construction work of the new Parliament House of India is one of the most important stages of our democratic tradition What is new of this We shall see\n\nAmidst Sanskrit chants by priests from the Sringeri Mutt in Karnataka PM Modi performed rituals around a holy pyre Priests from other religious faiths also offered prayers and blessing as the foundation stone was layer  This mutt was actively engaged for years in BJPs Ayodhya projectDD photo\n\nThe new parliament building is the key piece of the Rs 20000crore Central Vista project which aims to build and refurbish the government buildings on part of the 3 km Rajpath that stretches from the presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan to the iconic war memorial India Gate\n\nThe construction cannot begin for now with the Supreme Court hearing many many petitions challenging the project But the Court gave a green signal for the function even before the petitions are disposed of After all it involved the Prime Minister\n\nAnd the top Court nowadays is known not to create any problems for the establishment Like in Indira Gandhis days it is a committed judiciary Cases are filed heard and disposed of It is inevitable These are vagaries of Indian democracy and rule of Law It heard the Rafael case had initially expressed some doubts but finally fell in line The Union Govt submitted that there was a typo or grammar mistake in the affidavit it filed The court listened and heeded\n\nIt is an impressive project and I wish it all success I am privileged to be invited to the foundation stone laying ceremony said Ratan Tata Chairman Tata Trusts Tata Projects Ltd has been given contract for the construction project of the new Parliament building He was one of the 200 dignitaries invited to the function Why only Ambani and Adani others too have a share in the cake they seem to convey \n\nIf the old Parliament House gave direction to postindependence India the new building would become a witness to the creation of Atmanirbhar Bharat If work is done to fulfill the needs of the country in the old Parliament House then the aspirations of 21st century India will be fulfilled in the new building Modi said at the foundationlaying ceremony of new Parliament building The proposed fourstoried building would sprawl over an area of 64500 sq meters and cost an estimated Rs 971 crore It is a part of the Central Vista project\n\nAtmanirbhar Bharat is built by more and more of FDI including 100 in defence sector more and more of subservience to USA even while calling for boycotting China goods for sometime at least And by selling PSUs as a part of disinvestment  begun by PVN and Manmohan regimes and hastened by Modiled BJP What they did in decades is done in a fast pace by us it is asserted\n\nWhat is new The current parliament building built a century ago has served in shaping India PM Modi said It was built by colonial British rulers and helped shaping a comprador India Now it is being renovated to serve a neocolonial era He added It has undergone several renovations and security and technological upgradations but it has reached its capacity It is now seeking rest\n\nMedia Policy  Selfcensorship is now part of the undeclared Emergency\n\nModis is a remark not just about the building but about the edifice of Indian democracy  It is now seeking rest The old model is slow seeking rest and hence laid to rest The mainstream media largely fell in line followed by the Courts It was established how several recent CJIs served the rulers Prasahant Bhushan had dared and alleged nearly half of the last 1617 CJIs were corrupt and pliable He refused to withdraw his charges\n\nWhile Modis India is pursuing an Atmanirbhar Bhjarat on way to becoming a super power and claims to be the largest democracy  many liberals are not impressed\n\nMany senior editors have left their jobs at various influential media outlets rather they are eased out by the media owners Media was part of democracy it was being said It is now business with all its risks Several senior editors including of EPW were retired and given rest\n\nFear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me PM Modi quoted Bharati It applies to him and his regime more than ever when it comes to media policy They do not fear but instill fear\n\nWorld Press Freedom Index the Parisbased Reporters Without Borders said that India was 138thranked in the world out of 180 countries measured that was in April 2018 down two positions since 2017 that was lower than countries like Zimbabwe Afghanistan and Myanmar When the index was started in 2002 India was ranked 80th out of 139 countries surveyed As liberalization advanced under Congress and BJP illiberal media policy was gathering pace Then the Index gradually fell to 140 in 2019 and 142 in May 2020 This is how Modis india is now ranked by his democracy allies It was a steep fall from 80 to 142 Yet India claimingly marches ahead with democracy\n\nDeath rape threats from Hindutva zealots\n\nReporters Without Borders had said in 2018 that with Hindu nationalists trying to purge all manifestations of antinational thought from the national debate selfcensorship is growing in the mainstream media and journalists are increasingly the targets of online smear campaigns by the most radical nationalists who vilify them and even threaten physical reprisals\n\nJournalists say that media proprietors who often have multiple kinds of businesses are risk averse and can be leaned on by the government Selfcensorship is part of the undeclared Emergency now in vogue It is a form the ruling classes increasingly adopted ever since Indira Gandhi met her electoral waterloo in late 1970s ModiShah duo perfected it perhaps it is also a part of their Skill India State governments irrespective of the party in power are emulating it Even the LDF in Kerala deployed UAPA encounters media gags There is cooperative federalism with respect to enforcing a police state The Centre is leading the pack of wolves There is no censorship on trolls and threats on social media even while critics are traced and punished\n\nMedia proprietors are notorious for reading the tea leaves they get a clear sense of the tolerance level of politicians in power said senior journalist Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire Government ministers have coined this word presstitute to describe journalists who are unfriendly to them or who dont do their bidding he had said in 2018 Reuters April 27 2018 Now he himself is in trouble\n\nIndia is going through an aggressive variant of McCarthyism against the media said Prannoy Roy cofounder of NDTV Indias first private news channel in 2018 He had a taste of it recently\n\nBharatiyaar wrote that women should walk with their head held high while looking people in the eye Modi quoted Subramanya Bharati Sagarika Ghose a columnist with the Times of India was one woman journalist who dared to see in the eyes of the regime Her experience She said she is viciously trolled for any criticism of the administration  The minute I write something I get droves of hate mail Ghose said I have had death threats and gang rape threats on social media and also through letters sent to my home They know where I live Thousands are paid and employed for this job by many sangh parivar topping the list\n\nMediapersons  writers and Democratic and Human Rights activists are now booked under UAPA and sedition laws\n\nRavish Kumar a news anchor for NDTVs Hindilanguage channel said he has been constantly harassed and threatened by progovernment activists This is very organised he told Reuters They follow me When I go out to report a crowd gathers in 10 minutes\n\nReporters Without Borders counted instances of Indian journalists being killed because of what they write At least three of the journalists murdered in 2017 were targeted in connection with their work it said There were more in later years That was the fate of many including RTI activists\n\nBobby Ghosh the editor of the Hindustan Times one of Indias premier newspapers quit in 2017 September shortly after Modi met its owner Senior journalists familiar with the situation said they were told that Modi was unhappy with Ghoshs editorial policies The journalists told Reuters that Ghosh fell out of favour with the government after he launched a webpage called the Hate Tracker a database of violent crimes based on religion race ethnicity gender or sexual orientation The database was taken down next month in October Ghosh the paper as well as the PMO declined to comment\n\nSenior editor Harish Khare resigned as editorinchief of the widely read Tribune newspaper the same year He told Reuters his relations with the Tribunes controlling trust nosedived after the newspaper published a story exposing flaws in Aadhaar the governments national identity card project The newspapers trust denied and claimed the reporter was in fact rewarded Perhaps it was a parting gift\n\nThe parivar has no fear It is trying all dirty tricks Tamil people had tasted fascism decades ago from Dravidian parties They did not hesitate to manhandle justice Tarkunde in public There was Keelvelmani massacre of 1968 44 dalit laborers killed by landlords haunted for decades and all culprits were finally acquitted Dalits were hunted dalit panchayat presidents were not allowed to sit in office in some places even while selfrespect is mouthed Tamilnadu is witness to love jihad of PMK type Now fascism of Hindutva variety is being brewed\n\nAttempts are being made to form alliances of fascists unify fascists Fascism is fascism secular or communal Southern or northern The language of fascism is the same whether in Tamil or in Hindi The task before Tamilians is to shed fear and resist That is the message of Bharati ironically Modi reminded\n\nThe inputs on media are based on a report by Reuters April 27 2018 It was titled Indian journalists say they are intimidated ostracised if they criticise Modi and the BJP httpsinreuterscomarticleindiapoliticsmediaanalysisidINKBN1HY0AQ \n\nThe writer was a mediaperson\n\nSIGN UP

                "Summary": "Lt Gen Bhopinder Singh Retd\n\nUnknown to the author when he published his article Withering fate of Jammu Dogras 7th Dec there was a write up by Prof RR Sharma Amazing Visions of Jammu Janus Faced 28th Novin the Daily Excelsior critiquing the authors earlier article Branding Jammu The Most Valourous City of India 3rd Jun While disagreeing with the authors postulated hypothesis of selecting a UniqueSellingProposition USP for Jammu is part of a healthy intellectual and necessary debate  however misquoting from the article and its suppositions is not appropriate\n\nProf Sharma misrepresents in his article that the author had referenced Kolkata and some other cities as examples of potentially Valourous cities by writing There are several cities is India which have to their credit their valourous legends Their names are mentioned by Gen Bhupinder Singh such as Hyderabad Varanasi Chandigarh Kolkota Most hilarious is his description of Kolkota He writes Kolkota has amplified its year long revelry and festivity I am rather amused Kolkota is known for its great sons of the soil such as Rabindranath Tagore perhaps the first Indian to be honoured with Nobel Prize There are several other Bengalis who are well known and admired in the whole country This is certainly an imaginative interpretation of what was actually written as the author had explicitly stated that different cities in India are known by various brands monikers owing to the USP that each has appropriated and invested in eg ITbased references for Hyderabad Planned Citybased references for Chandigarh City of Light for Kolkata etc I quote from the actual text of the article published on 3rd June Hyderabad cleverly dovetailed its Information Technology IT forays towards Cyberabad Chandigarh remains the quintessential Planned City or City Beautiful Varanasi invokes its timeless antiquity and religiousity to be the mystic the City of Lights Kolkata has amplified its yearround revelry and festivity in a City of Joy that never disappoints etc Even States like Kerala have invested heavily and reaped the benefit of its Gods own country to signify the multitude of religious denominations Just having all the elements of a brand are not enough as they need to be chiseled articulated and creatively posited for public consumption Nowhere was Kolkata referenced as an example of a potentially Valourous city as implied and decried in Prof Sharmas suggestions One can intellectually differ on opinions ie whether to call Jammu The Most Valourous City of India or not but we cannot differ on stated facts as were published\n\nMy limited point of suggesting the rather martialsounding USP for Jammu as opposed to appropriating the City of Temples was that it is a branding nomenclature that has already been appropriated by cities like Varanasi the oldest living city in the world or Madurai  both of a certain antiquity religiousreverence and psychological national imprint that is difficult to outshine as yet another claimant This does not diminish the importance of Jammus temples just as it does not dampen Himachal Pradeshs claims of Dev Bhoomi as also of exactly same branding by Uttarakhand There are simply many too claimants already Though there are no formulaic right or wrong in deciding upon a USP for destination branding as it remains a matter of choice and decision  therefore the author felt that since the potential branding of Most Valourous City of India remains unclaimed is importantly beyond questioning sheer number of gallantry awardees of Indian Armed Forces from Duggar Lands including the HimachalPunjab tracts for whom Jammu remains the epicenter of Dograness and could be a powerful stirring and galvanizing claim that would resonate deeply amongst all proud Indians across the length and breadth of the country Not only could it add the muchneeded weight of a Value Proposition but it also has a sticky rousing and emotional quality about it that would shame the hitherto indifferent citizenry for having ignored such a landpeople who have done so much for the nation selflessly since time immemorial\n\nAs a former combatant who has served in the most unforgiving trying and unreachable frontiers of the country the author does not share the view that the heroics conquests or the raw gallantry of a General Zorawar Singh were any lesser than that of Napoleon the Great as suggested by Prof Sharma  however that too is a matter of perception we could agree to disagree From a purely militaristic perspective to scale dislodge and conquer lands in such punishing topography as was done by General Zorawar Singh requires almost superhuman courage leadership and capabilities Whereas the French have invested assiduously to protect create and even romanticize the imagery of Napoleon which has cemented his definitive iconography and imagery across the world From dramatic paintings idealizing statements to even mythmaking the French created the generouslydashing and cavalier image of a conqueror that successfully suppressed contrary views of historians like Victor Davis Hanson who note rather soberly After all the military record is unquestioned17 years of wars perhaps six million Europeans dead France bankrupt her overseas colonies lost But the French clearly understood the power necessities and urgency of creating striking and resonating brands\n\nBeyond clarifications pertaining to my earlier article and in repositing the rationale for branding JammuDogras with the tag of unmatched valour  I draw from experience of serving along with Dogra troops of various Indian Army Regiments even though I am from the fiery and illustrious Rajput Regiment myself I have always sensed an unsaid humility civility and reclusiveness in soldiers from the Duggar lands that sometimes becomes counterproductive especially for the task on hand The tag of Gentleman Soldiers is indeed a matter of wellearned dignity as these hardy but simple soldiers are second to none in battle The naturally genteel refinement of Duggar soldiers still bore the likes of Maj Somnath Sharma Brig Rajendra Jamwal Subedar Bana Singh Captain Vikram Batra Maj Ajay Jasrotia Captain GS Salaria etc an unending list of valour that importantly cuts across the religiocasteist divides So by extrapolating this psychographic frame onto the entirety of populace  it is unsurprising that the silence of Dogras has been conveniently and imprecisely decoded as that warranting no correction recourse or addressability in the national urgencies Jammu continues to be taken for granted and languishes in desperate need for investments jobopportunities civicinfrastructure etc etc When all other regionalethnic formations across the country are busy vying for national and political attention the voice of concern for the JammuDogras remains unheard in Delhi While the other regions often have a distinct religiocasteist underpinning the Dogra woes are rooted in the constitutional morality of potentially presenting itself as one of unity in diversity There is a clear case to shun the conventional divides that is the instinctive wont of most nationalregional parties as that fragments the inclusiveDogra identity to its disadvantage The fact that I am only married to a very proud Jamwal Dogra and have an outsiders perspective  one wonders at the incredulity and inexplicability as to why JammuDogras who have always punched above their weight for the nation still remain essentially unacknowledged unsung and unrecognised for their stellar performance and achievements Perhaps the starting point is be less harsh critical and diffident about oneself as there is enough and more in terms of powerful assets for JammuDogras to invoke and project unlike the efforts that may have gone for branding Napoleon the Great for themselves  especially since there is a umbilical thread of civilisational nobility and constitutional morality that binds patriotism and unity in diversity both of which JammuDogras have in ample quantity if only they wished to believe so\n\nThe

                "Summary": "Anil Anand\n\nOver two dozen opposition parties supported the December 8 2020 Bharat Bandh call in support of the farmers protest against three newly enacted farm laws By all means a healthy development for a democracy and given the fact that the opposition has been in tatters and wilting under the might of the BJP\n\nWhat is visible for the last few years is a ruling party with brute majority having its way unmindful of the long term consequences and a totally disarrayed opposition getting weaker by the day This is a phenomenon which is antithesis to what the democracy stands for and it has not happened for the first time in last 70 years A strong ruling party and an equally strong opposition ideally maintain balance in a democratic set up\n\nSo the opposition unity or semblance of it has at last come After supporting the bandh the opposition parties managed to close their ranks without creating much fuss at least visibly and met President of India to present a memorandum regarding the farm laws\n\nIn this backdrop the question that still haunts the public mind is that whether the opposition unity has really arrived Will their leaders truly close their ranks and put a cap on their ambitions to show a united face\n\nAn answer in the right affirmative is still miles away The only difference and silverlining in this latest attempt at opposition unity is that the opposition rank has swelled with some of the NDA allies till recently have also made a common cause on the issue of farmers protests on farm laws In one way this is a healthy development towards achieving a broader opposition unity as it is also a reflection of the BJPs increasing syndrome of ekla chalo Since the ruling party has gained from strength to strength under the powerful leadership of Mr Narendra Modi during the last over six years ostensibly it is unwilling to carry the burden of the allies anymore\n\nThe two of the BJPs oldest allies ever since the NDA was formed Shiromani Akali Dal SAD and Shiv Sena have already parted ways More significantly the SAD under the veteran political leader Mr Parkash Singh Badal quit the NDA on the issue of farm laws although the chasm between the two was growing for quite some time The Shiv Sena which quit the NDA on the issue of Maharashtra chief ministership has since joined hands with the once archrival Congress to head the state government The others who have suddenly discovered a common cause with Congressled opposition are Telengana Rashtriya Samithi TRS of Mr K Chandrashekhaer Rao Mr Naveen Patnaiks Biju Janata Dal Mr Jagan Mohan Reddys YSR Congress and some other smaller regional parties\n\nThis silverlining in the form of greater opposition unity if at all continues beyond the farmers cause will come at a cost unless the leaders of these erstwhile NDA supporting parties enter into the oppositionlock without any condition Of course the reference here is to the individual ambitions of their leaders as many of them visualise themselves as future Prime Ministers There is no dearth of such leaders in the other opposition parties as well\n\nThe one weaklink behind this silverlining is that all these former NDA allies are joining the opposition grouping from a position of weakness They are doing so when their on being abandoned by the big brother BJP\n\nAnother silverlining in this NovemberDecember 2020 opposition unity is the Samajwadi Party SP and Bahujan Samaj Party BSP coming out of the selfimposed political agyatwas or so to say to back the farmers agitation and the bandh call For obvious reasons both SP chief Mr Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Miss Mayawati had been maintaining a studied silence and refrained from criticising the Narendra Modi Government On the contrary they have been obliquely backing the Government Since the two parties are the main force in the opposition ranks in the politically significant Uttar Pradesh their silence has been a great set back to opposition unity\n\nOn paper the scenario for opposition unity seems impressive But it is still a long way off to turn into a reality Personal ambitions of the leaders apart there are still many crossconnections that determine or annihilate the political interests of a particular party or its leader in their respective states or regions The only realisation if it dawns on them that their hegemonic pocketboroughs or areas of political influence are fast melting under the influence of Mr Modi can truly bring them together Or else the BJP despite the questionable policy decisions of its Governments at the Centre and in states and failure to meet the aspirations of the people in relation to the promises held out will continue to have a free run\n\nFor example the assembly poll bound West Bengal is a case study though the phenomenon was not new in terms of forging opposition unity There are three main constituents for the opposition unity in the state namely the Left Block Trinmool Congress and the Congress There seems to be no chance of the three coming together to check the growing influence of the BJP which has already become the main opposition force in the state and has pulled all stops for the assembly elections\n\nThe farmers strike or the Bharat Bandh had created an opportunity for all three to come together However the battlelines for the state assembly elections perhaps prevented them from coming together to meet a bigger challenge and performing a bigger constitutional duty of providing a strong opposition Not to be seen as going along with the Left Block Trinmool Congress though wholeheartedly supporting the farmers agitation decided against supporting the Bharat Bandh to avoid sharing any space wht the Left parties on the streets of Kolkatta on the bandh day\n\nThere is no denying the fact that regional or state leaders such as Miss Banerjee Mr Patnaik and Mr Chandrashekhar Rao owe their political existence to localised power centres But given the fact that they have been playing an important role at the national levels also in this era of coalitions they cannot absolve themselves of their national duty They must realise that only a strong opposition would be able to checkmate the powerful governments in the national interest\n\nThe options for the ilk of these three leaders are absolutely shrinking given the fact that the BJP strategists are more strongly fathoming their own chances in the hitherto unchartered territories such as West Bengal Orissa Tamil Nadu Telengana Punjab Andhra Pradesh etc Miss Banerjee might retain her fortress through a solo effort but even that would not augur well for Trinmool Congresss survival in future And the same is true of other leaders\n\nMore importantly the Congress the only national party in the opposition with a panIndia presence must resolve its own conundrum without any further delay This is for the simple reason no opposition unity is possible either without Congress acting as a fulcrum or the regional players The adversarial goalposts at the regional and state levels should be shifted to create a common goalpost to defend it from the onslaughts of the BJP\n\nfeedbackexcelsiorgmailcom",

                "Summary": "Uddipana Goswami a 27yearold Hyderabadbased corporate professional is not quite holding her breath for a Covid19 vaccine I trust our scientists and their work but not politically driven statements said Goswami\n\nGoswami cited prime minister Narendra Modis address to opposition leaders at an allparty meeting in the first week of December where he said the vaccine would be available in India within weeks\n\nTill the other day there was no vaccine but suddenly after Britain Mr Prime Minister announces that within weeks a vaccine will come she said I am not a fool\n\nThen she pointed out offensive statements that the Bharatiya Janata Party which is in power at the Centre had made over the last couple of months She was referring to the party promising free vaccines if voted to power during the Bihar Assembly and Hyderabad civil polls campaigns It is a shame that a humanitarian crisis has been turned into a political agenda she said\n\nNo vaccination rush\n\nGoswamis apprehensions may have to do more with her politics but her hesitancy to get inoculated against Covid19 may be more common than one might imagine In an online survey carried out by LocalCircles a community social media platform which received over 25000 responses from 262 districts nearly 60 said they would not rush to take a vaccine even if it was available by February\n\nConsidering the pandemic has completely upended peoples lives for almost a yearand vaccines are being projected as the only possible way to halt the viruss chargethe results of the survey would perhaps appear to be somewhat counterintuitive notwithstanding the usual caveats of online surveys\n\nSafe and effective\n\nVaccine hesitancy is complex and driven by several factors\n\nBut experts warn against drawing simplistic connections Vaccine hesitancyloosely defined as the phenomenon of people refusing to get inoculated despite the presence of a safe and effective vaccineis complex and driven by several factors\n\nAlso the idea of safe and effective itself could be sometimes contested as conversations around Covid19 vaccines illustrate Many have raised questions on whether a vaccine developed within monthsvaccine trials usually stretch over several yearscan be deemed safe even if governments and corporations say so There is no way to know for sure that a vaccine is completely safe or effective with such a short period of testing over such few people said Prabir Chatterjee a doctor in rural Bengal\n\nChatterjee who has been part of Indias national polio surveillance project in various capacities said I am not saying the Pfizer vaccine which has been said to be safe and effective is not good because I do not know But anyone who tells you it has no problems is also lying There is simply no way to know so soonit will take a year at least\n\nSandhya Srinivasan a Mumbaibased public health researcher and journalist said to wait and watch as a section of people seems to be doing might be a very rational approach in the context of the Covid19 vaccine It made sense she said to weigh the possible risks of a new vaccine against ones own perceived risk of serious illness\n\nThe trust factor\n\nBut the seeming reluctance among Indians visàvis the Covid19 vaccine researchers say may extend beyond concerns about its science In other words there could be others like Goswami who may not doubt the science of the vaccines as much as the politics driving their availability\n\nTrust after all plays a key role in shaping public opinion towards vaccines explained Vijayprasad Gopichandran a community medicine physician from Chennai Indias Covid19 story so far on the other hand has been marred by episodes that did not inspire public confidence which Gopichandran said could have led to vaccine hesitancy\n\nHe referred to the serious adverse event reported in one of the vaccine trialswhich many alleged was mishandled and betrayed a lack of transparency on the part of the Indian authorities Then the BJPs promise to deliver free vaccines in Bihar if voted to power could have led to distrust in vaccination policy said Gopichandran Then of course more generally the health systems handling of the pandemic itself All these have contributed to the vaccine hesitancy said Gopichandran\n\nChatterjee too spoke of a trust deficit that he believed the current dispensation suffered from Unfortunately this government does not always tell the truth he said So even if it is pushing a good vaccine there will be some lies And since there is the social media and multiple news outlets these days the lies will get caught and depending on spin the news story is given one or the other community will get provoked and refuse to get vaccinated There is after all no dearth of groups or communities government has antagonised\n\nLet doctors do the talking\n\nThus it was absolutely imperative Chatterjee said that the vaccination approval process left no room for suspicion and experts communicated openly and clearly That has not happened so far according to Chatterjee\n\nA lot of doctors are already pissed off with the government for various reasons This is only going to make it worse\n\nHe said Why is the prime minister pushing it Let doctors do the talking We know he doesnt know about vaccines A lot of doctors are already pissed off with the government for various reasons This is only going to make it worse\n\nChatterjee who has spent long years working in the governments pulse polio and other routine immunisation programmes in east India drew on his own experiences When parents showed reluctance to let their children take the polio drops I would often take it in front of them to convince them it was safe he said And it worked I could do that because I was absolutely sure about its safety Maybe it was not effective as it was projected to be but it was 100 safe But let me tell you I am not going to take the Covid vaccine anytime soon\n\nIf doctors were unconvinced about a vaccine Chatterjee said immunisation programmes were hard to implement In Burdwan I remember it was the doctors who fought against the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine they refused to give it he said So we could not give it there\n\nVaccine hesitancy in India\n\nHistorically Indian policymakers have enthusiastic backers of the idea of vaccination as an idea Independent India s immunisation record the historian Niels Brimnes writes in his book The Politics of Vaccination A Global History is largely one of acceptance and implementation of the international agenda set by WHO or the World Health Organisation\n\nAccording to Brimes the majority of Indians accepted immunisation Reluctance whenever it happened Brimes writes was often due to indifference or vague fears about imperfectly understood practices and organised ideological or political opposition was rare\n\nYet some of Indias most influential politicians had strong reservations about vaccination There was of course Mohandas Gandhi who was opposed to the idea of vaccination Gandhis contention was that sanitation was a more useful and morally acceptable alternative\n\nC Rajagopalachari whom Gandhi had once described as a conscience keeper strongly opposed the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis Rajagopalachari was not convinced about the safety of the vaccinebut there was more to his opposition An ardent nationalist Rajagopalachari believed that Indians were being used as research subjects for the sake of Western science\n\nAnother wellknown vaccine sceptic in modern India was Debabar Banerji an academic Banerji wasnt antivaccination as such but thought of it as a topdown quick fix that skirted Indias public health problems He had a postcolonial critique too he believed the West was imposing vaccination on developing countries as penance for its year of plundering as a colonial force without taking the pain to invest in making structural investment in health infrastructures\n\nApart from these wellarticulated strands of opposition there have been many instances of vaccine hesitancy at the community level driven by a variety of factors such as media misinformation and political insecurities Fears of impotency seen most recently among Muslim communities in the states of Haryana Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Assam also been a major driver of hesitancy\n\nThe politics of resistance\n\nResearchers and doctors however say no one demography or geography is more prone to antivaccination tendencies I first encountered fears of impotency in relation to the polio vaccine among the Rajput community in 2000 in Banka district said Chatterjee And it was only after that it shifted to the Muslims\n\nPeople had started to believe the health department was only for family planning\n\nGopichandran said a lot of welleducated proscience rational people have become aware and are raising questions about vaccines The MR measlesrubella vaccine met with major hesitancy in welleducated pockets of Tamil Nadu and Kerala he said\n\nRegardless of the source of hesitancy it is important to address them say experts People who raise reasonable doubts about vaccines are labelled antivaxxers which is a way of shutting down any criticism of specific vaccines and how they are administered and funding agencies and government policies that include unnecessary inappropriate or unsafe vaccines said Srinivasan\n\nFor instance Srinivasan pointed out marginalised communities may resist because they feel that health workers approach them only for contraceptionsterilisation related programmes\n\nIndeed as several research studies have revealed minority communities in Uttar Pradesh resisted the polio vaccination drive because they felt the state was insensitive to their other health needs The sterilisation rumours only were only the immediate trigger Fears of sterilisation were real as for years people had family planning shoved down their throats said Chatterjee Thats why those rumours of impotency because people had started to believe the health department was only for family planning\n\nAs sociologist Harish Naraindas who has studied vaccination in India put it Rumours may be an allegory or a moral commentary if you wish on both state and society\n\nBesides observers say that lack of robust redressal mechanisms to deal with possible vaccinerelated adverse events could also drive hesitancy The state may not have legal provisions in place to address vaccinerelated morbidity including sick leave job loss etc arising from its short or long term consequences pointed out Naraindas\n\nThen there was the oftenoverlooked matter of consent In 2018 the Delhi governments campaign to administer the measlesrubella vaccine to students at school ran into trouble after parents complained that their consent had not been sought Thus vaccine hesitancy Srinivasan explained had a lot to do with how people are approached and how information is shared and consent is asked for and taken\n\nVaccine hesitancy Chatterjee said could be dealt withbut it required policymakers to be deft and gentle Its all about taking time to understand who is hesitating why they are hesitating so that you can strategise how to win them over he said\n\nThis reporting was supported by a grant

                "Summary": "Monitoring Desk\n\nFor generations familyrun farms in South India have grown and produced the natural dye that was once colonial capital\n\nIt is 6am in the small village of Kongarapattu in South India and the cloudy October sky is threatening to burst In the factory a foreman scuttles around anxiously checking for absent labourers two sariclad neighbours whisper to one another while combing their long hair and stray dogs run amok sensing the anticipation in the air\n\nFor four generations indigo has been grown harvested and made into dye on this familyowned plot in Tamil Nadu\n\nProduction which usually takes place three times a year was delayed this year because of the coronavirus pandemic But October finally brought the first day of thotti podurathu  when the traditional tanks are set up to extract the dye from the Indigofera plants\n\nBefore work can begin labourers and onlookers gather around the centuryold tanks for a simple pooja or prayer invoking divine blessings The foreman says a twominute prayer for Neel Atha or the Blue Mother  the sacred name the villagers have for indigo  and presents an offering of bananas and coconut blessed fruits according to Hindu rituals\n\nIt is almost a festival for our village says Balachander Anbhazhagan The 33yearold is the scion of KMA Exports an indigo farming and production company that has operated here since the 1960s\n\nBalachanders greatgrandfather started processing indigo during colonial times  when the naturally sourced dye was a valuable commodity\n\nThe Anbhazhagan family perfected the patient craft of extracting natural indigo dye from Indigofera plants using the same centuryold colonialera cement tanks their relatives used before them\n\nAll these years later the company is now the largest producer of natural indigo dye in India\n\nEven as a child I grew up with indigo all around me says the softspoken Balachander I have watched the indigo plants being harvested and have seen my grandmother offer her prayers to the Neel Atha before beginning indigo extraction at our plant\n\nHere indigo is perceived as a Blue Goddess In fact many Hindu Gods like Kaali and Krishna are often portrayed in the colour blue as it symbolises the colour of the cosmos\n\nWe envisage work as worship Balachander says\n\nGreen leaves to blue dye\n\nDuring colonial times many Indian farmers were strongarmed by the British Raj into growing indigo instead of food crops the dye was then bought by the Raj at unfairly low prices Today indigo is celebrated in Kongarappatu and neighbouring villages for putting them on the map a far cry from its wretched colonial past Every year export companies handicraft industries and renowned designers come knocking on the doors of this nondescript village to get their hands on the precious blue gold\n\nThe work of getting dye from Indigofera happens in stages First the leaves are harvested from neighbouring farms then they are gathered together and immersed in a huge tank filled with water where they are weighed down and allowed to ferment After the fermentation the leaves are removed and the water is drained into another massive tank where the solution oxidises and sediment settles at the bottom of the tank finally the sediment powder is dried and packed into cakes\n\nIndigofera plants which look a bit like basil must be harvested just before their pink flowers bloom Then the leaves have to reach the first tank within three hours in order to yield the best quality indigo Balachander says\n\nA fiveminute drive away from the extraction unit  past simple concrete village houses and a group of children playing cricket in a coconut grove  is an inconspicuous indigo farm where the leaves are ready for harvest Out in the fields the female farmers smile at the presence of strangers while the men seem to acknowledge the visitors less\n\nIn minutes sickles swinging deftly the men and women harvest the lush Indigofera plants that have grown about 10cm four inches high They then bundle up their bounty of leaves load it on a tractor and bring it to the tanks\n\nBack at the extraction unit one of the tanks is already full from the previous day wooden logs secured over the sea of leaves to keep the plants immersed in the water that shines with a greenishblue hue\n\nWith the pooja complete the foreman opens a hole in the upper tank and the water gushes into the tank below it After that to help the indigo particles settle as sediment at the bottom of the lower tank the water has to be aerated a process that used to be far more picturesque\n\nJust a few years back four labourers would stand in the tank and create turbulence in the water by kicking it for two hours says Balachander explaining the old process of aeration Now I had repurposed a machine used in aquaculture to mechanise this process\n\nFor 45 minutes the pedalling machine moves the water around kicking up a foamy layer In an hours time the greenish liquid turns into a brilliant blue The top slot of the tank is then opened up letting out water that will be used to irrigate nearby farms After 21 hours of sedimentation the bottom slot is opened to slowly release the remaining water in the tank together with a leftover powderlike substance This is then boiled in a brick kiln filtered and pressed and formed into small indigo cakes The cakes are dried for five days before they are ready to be used as dye\n\nAn ancient craft\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye 48yearold Pachaiyappan holds out his indigocoloured palms stained with the remains of another day spent turning Indigofera plants into blocks of dye\n\nFor five months every year for the last 20 years the farm labourer has travelled from the outskirts of Kongrapattu to the Anbhazhagans estate to do this work\n\nThis colour will remain in my hand for a week he says but till date this work has had no negative impact on my health as everything is natural\n\nPachaiyappan is so adept at the work that he can gauge when to stop the oxidation process by merely looking at the colour of the water He is also known for pressing the boiled indigo sediment into perfectlyshaped cakes\n\nAs a child I remember my father working in this very unit With no motor then he used to work on an etham  a traditional water irrigation device  to fill the tanks He used to sing a song while walking up and down a 20foot pole even as another helper filled the water in a pail which was then used to fill the tanks Now things arent complicated We dont even have to beat the water any more to oxidise it Pachaiyappan says\n\nBalachander says the manufacturing process has largely remained the same through the generations with the exception of some improved mechanisation to ease things for the labourers The most important thing for him is maintaining the original quality of the dye\n\nWe cant afford even a speck of dirt in our indigo cakes he reminds his team as they go about their work\n\nBalachander joined the family business in 2013 But it was not always part of his plan\n\nI did not plan on taking up my fathers business he tells Al Jazeera But while pursuing my MBA in the United States I had the opportunity of studying the supply chain management of our indigo production The more I read about indigos history and learned of its ecofriendly nature the more I was hooked\n\nIt came as a huge relief for his father farmerbusinessman M Anbhazhagan 63 who was eager to pass on the secrets of the craft to the next generation\n\nRemembering the day he himself joined the business in 1982 Anbhazhagan says My father had received only 10 cents 4356 square feet of land from my grandfather for indigo farming and he had just two tanks for indigo production an extraction tank where the harvested plants were seeped overnight and a sedimentation tank where the fermented water was oxidised manually by men by kicking the greenishblue water\n\nAnbhazhagan looks through pictures of his parents smiling behind a younger version of him and tells us that it is their blessings that helped him grow an indigo empire in his small village\n\nWhen he took over the business Anbhazhagan chose to sell directly to the artisans instead of selling it to agents This tripled our profits and by the early 90s we expanded it to four tanks  two for extraction and two for sedimentation Each tank could hold easily up to two tonnes of indigo plants and yields nearly 35kgs of indigo powder\n\nWhile the family now owns about 30 acres 12 hectares of land they also have contracts with other indigo farmers in hundreds of villages across Tamil Nadu allowing them to harvest more plants It amounts to nearly 2500 acres 1011 hectares in indigo production\n\nThe family is also proud of the fact that the work is sustainable\n\nThe best thing about this process is it is zero waste as the spent indigo leaves from the first tank are taken back to the fields for composting and the water from the second tank is used for irrigation Balachander says The older Anbhazhagan recalls that back in the day the leftover indigo leaves were the only fertiliser his father used for his other crops like millets or paddy It works as a great nitrogen fixer for the soil he explains\n\nIndigo has also helped the surrounding community Indigo is one of the main cash crops here and has helped farmers earn a decent living due to the thriving export dyeing business says Anbhazhagan I am happy that we have been able to provide work to at least 75 people in processing of indigo leaves\n\nWhere the blood is blue\n\nFinding a skilled and obliging workforce is not easy for all indigo producers Four kilometres 25 miles away from Kongrapattu farmer Mohammed Ayub 39 is trying to revive his familys legacy in indigo dye making in Vengandur in the coastal Villupuram district But he has encountered some roadblocks\n\nLocal women believe that Neel Amma another local term of endearment for indigo that translates to Blue Mother doesnt like women working in the tanks he says With most men migrating out of our villages to find work in cities its been very tough to find skilled labourers to make indigo dye\n\nAyub is a man of few words and it takes a while for the farmerproducer to open up about his familys journey with the mystical indigo His great grandfather worked in the court of Tipu Sultan  an 18thcentury ruler of Mysore from the neighbouring state of Karnataka he says After Tippu Sultans death in 1799 Ayubs family relocated to Vellore district and then settled in Vengandur in the 1830s\n\nAs indigo was in high demand at that time my great grandfather Janab Mohideen Basha took up the cultivation of Indigofera Tinctoria a plant known to produce a good quality indigo dye In fact records show that England alone imported 40000 tonnes of Indigo from India in 1895\n\nThe coronavirus also caused Ayub to temporarily shut down his indigo operations but he agrees to give a tour of the estate Right in the middle of a busy highway a large dilapidated wall welcomes us Behind it are four huge tanks largely overrun with wild shrubs and plants Despite the vehicles whizzing by there is hardly any human presence around At a distance a shepherd can be seen reigning in his bleating sheep\n\nAyub explains that he last ran the tank in January before the lockdowns commenced For the visitor it feels like being in a time capsule The pleasant indigo fields guarded by tall coconut trees provide a perfect backdrop to the 1515foot 4545metre indigo tanks\n\nFor two centuries these cascading tanks have magically transformed lush green indigo leaves into the deepest shades of blue dye Behind it is a 12foothigh 37metrehigh colonial brick kiln which is still used to boil the indigo mixture A little further on the right the gleaming water in a 36footdeep 11metredeep ancient well that has stood for generations is a reminder of all that indigo has survived  from world wars to revolts to chemical dyes to the current coronavirus crisis\n\nOf colonial oppression and revolution\n\nIndigo also known as the King of Dyes is one of the worlds most ancient dyes It has been used by the people of Egypt and Asia for more than 4000 years Even a 12thcentury Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about indigo a product of India being a slime that adheres to the scum upon reeds When it is sifted out it is black but in dilution it yields a marvellous mixture of purple and blue \n\nEven until the 19th century when synthetic indigo was discovered the Indigofera plant was the only known source to achieve longlasting blue Though several countries in East Asia produced indigo India remained a major source for the world In the late 1500s French and Norwegian officials even banned the Indian indigo calling it the devils dye to protect the production of their native woadbased blue dye For the East India Company and later the British Raj indigo turned out to be one of the most profitable commodities\n\nTushar Gandhi Mahatma Gandhis greatgrandson talks about how this blue gold led to one of the most defining moments of Indian independence\n\nIndigo was a very precious dying source for textileproducing mills of England When it was discovered that it grew well in certain North Indian states  like Bengal and Bihar  they utilised the zamindar or landowner and landlord system to force the cultivation of indigo instead of food crops he tells Al Jazeera via telephone\n\nIn mid19th century Bengal these farmers were provided loans with such extremely high interest rates that it would pass on to the next generations forcing descendants to become bonded indigo labourers The selling price disparity was also so high that the farmers were only given 25 percent of what the indigo would fetch on a global market he explains\n\nIn 1859 the distraught Bengal farmers led a revolt that practically brought indigo production to its knees Following the revolt a commission was set to study the state of indigo peasants The Indigo Commission report had then observed not a chest of Indigo reached England without being stained with human blood\n\nIt was in Bengals first uprising against indigo dictatorship that farmers took oppressors to court and won a landmark judgement in their favour Tushar Gandhi says Years later Bihar farmers reeled under the oppressive teenkathia system where indigo had to be mandatorily grown in 320th of a farmland With discovery of chemical dye by Germany in 1878 the indigo market collapsed and the farmers situation in Bihar became even more deplorablehttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nIn 1917 when Mahatma Gandhi visited Champaran to meet and document the issues of the indigo farmers it led to his first nonviolent Satyagraha movement march for truth\n\nI believe Gandhi based his strategy on Bengals precedence to demand legal justice At that time the greatest oppression was against the agrarian community There were agrarian revolts in many places and even though they were dispersed they became a formidable force to deal with Tushar Gandhi adds Babu was shrewd enough to identify this segment and other impoverished craftsmen who were left unemployed by the industrial revolution he used their unity to fight the battles for Indian Independence\n\nFaithful farmers\n\nWhile wars and revolts shook the indigo market Ayubs family has been faithfully growing indigo together with other crops like sugarcane and groundnut for four generations since the 1830s\n\nOne reason could be indigo is a lowcost crop There is no need for any external fertiliser and you can get a yield every three months Ayub suggests But his uncle Niyaz Ahamed feels the crops are more about preserving their familys legacy\n\nWhile Ayub had left his career in the hospitality industry to return to farming in his village in 2016 Ahamed had in fact relocated from the village to the capital city Chennai in 2000 to secure a better education for his children Yet the mysterious blue refuses to let go of him he says Even in a city like Chennai while pursuing another business we are trying to produce indigo dyes in plastic drums It is a part of who we are says Ahamed with a hint of pride in his voice\n\nAlthough colonial indigo farming met much resistance in North India Ahamed says that his father Dada Miyan Sahib Ayubs paternal grandfather was always able to do business on his own terms  whether with British or French traders or later with the Indian railways department\n\nEven when we did not sow indigo we would still rent out the tank for indigo production to private companies My fathers only condition would be that they store the indigo dye in our house so that he can check and ensure the quality of the indigo before it is sold says Ahamed\n\nI still remember my father sneaking out indigo dye to Pondicherry a French colony at that time and whose border was closely monitored by the British Raj in India and while coming back he would bring us Chinese silk or a bottle of sugar mixed with water to avoid detection If caught he would have been arrested by the Raj\n\nAs for Vengandur indigo still plays an intrinsic role in the lives of people who live there\n\nWhenever a child is born in our village the cloth used for filtering the indigo dye is taken to swaddle the baby as it has medicinal properties Older children with ailments like fever are also made to sleep on a piece of indigodyed cloth for faster recovery We have also been regularly supplying indigo roots avari in local parlance to traditional healers who use it for various skin ailments and allergies And of course other farmers use our spent indigo sheaves as fertiliser for their fields says Ahamed\n\nThe art of natural dyeing\n\nIn Auroville an hours drive from Kongarapattu Jesus Ciriza Larraona is the founder of a natural dyeing research unit called The Colours of Nature For more than 25 years he has been perfecting the art of indigo dyeing learning from ancient texts and traditional craftsmen from across India and the world\n\nAt his premises a group of masked women sit embroidering at a corner table with their heads bowed in concentration Meanwhile other men and women twist and twirl sections of cotton yarn as they wash them clean two women dipping it in alum  a mordant used to set colours on fabric  while another dries a fresh batch of the yarn\n\nLarraona takes us to his sanctum sanctorum  a large shed where his indigo vats are kept A pungent smell fills the air amidst rows and rows of basket lids interspersing those rows are indigodripping cloth filters which hang from the top of the shed like bats in a belfry\n\nThere are 60 pots with 1000 litre capacity each Larraona says as he removes a basket lid to reveal the vat below that is used to dye raw materials indigo\n\nThe indigo in the vat sports a greenish hue with a blue foam bubbling around it Kumar one of Larraonas master craftsmen slowly immerses the white yarn in the vat and rotates After minutes of working the yarn emerges as a dark shade of green Another helper dries it out and in a matter of seconds the green transforms into the magical indigohttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nThe soluble indigo in the vat impregnates the white cloth When taken out it oxidises and becomes blue The processing time varies based on the shade of indigo one needs Larraona explains He sources his indigo cakes from farmerproducer Anbhazhagan in Kongarappatu\n\nLarraona is originally from Spain When asked how he ended up dyeing indigo in India he laughs In 1992 I was on my second visit to India when a friend in Barcelona had requested me to source a carpet to play chess So I went to Srinagar to find out more about the beautiful Kashmiri carpets The friendly locals had given me a shikara houseboat to discover the city on my own It was while exploring the pristine lakes I saw how the chemical dyeing of carpets was polluting the water bodies It disturbed me he says\n\nAs luck would have it he stumbled upon a colony that worked with natural dyes while looking for artisans to make chess figurines So when I decided to settle down in the international community of Auroville I chose to work on the art of natural dyeing and thus The Colours of Nature was born in 1993 But the journey was not easy\n\nI found an elaborative book on natural dyes from the 1890s and started to reproduce indigo But it was not working It was Mr Anbhazhagan who guided me to a Guledgudda in Karnataka a village renowned for Ilkal saris a traditional sari with cotton body and silk border The Hasilcar family there had dyed indigo for generations Two of the members agreed to come and teach me indigo dyeing in Auroville We started with four pots they knew all the techniques but the fermentation still wasnt right I then realised the Hasilcars had switched to synthetic indigo two decades ago hence couldnt remember the smell of the dye and were not able to handle the pot\n\nIt was after interacting with various dyeing experts from Japan Thailand and Mexico and reading several books that he was able to understand and revive the natural indigo fermentation process In fact he held a workshop to teach it back to the Hasilcars\n\nHe says that he continues to experiment to find more ecofriendly ways to dye and has not replaced the water in his vats for more than 24 years He now has plans to reuse the sediment in the vat as a fixing agent for other colours too  including yellow Marigold flower and red Rubia cordifolia\n\nThe synthetic challenge\n\nFor all the efforts Larraona has taken to preserve and revive the art of natural dyeing his toughest challenge has been dealing with synthetic colours that claim to be natural indigo in the market\n\nJagadda Rajappa an expert on natural dyeing and fabrics agrees that it is very hard to find unadulterated indigo in the Indian market The cost of the German synthetic indigo 300400 rupees per kilogramme  45kg is much lesser than natural indigo 3000 rupeeskg  41kg The reduction process is the same and it is very difficult for a buyer to find out if the dye used is natural or not\n\nAyub shares an insider tip saying natural indigo cakes normally float in water while chemical ones do not\n\nWhile Balachander tells us export companies do run tests for authenticity Rajappa opines that the Indian market is not as discerning towards natural dyes and hardly differentiates between the two But the new breed of green designers hopes to bring back the glory days of natural indigo in India\n\nYou will always find a block of natural indigo in my office claims Delhibased designer Rahul Mishra who is known for ecofriendly ensembles that highlight handmade fabrics and natural dyes He vaguely recalls his first experience with indigohttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nAs a child I remember seeing a huge building called Neel Kothi or blue house in my native village Malhausi Neel Kothis were indigo factories of the British era My grandmother revealed that almost everyone in the village grew indigo at some point of time Inspired by Gandhiji even my grandmother used to spin her own cotton and got it woven by a local weaver before indigo dyeing it herself\n\nThough Mahatma Gandhi fought against the indiscriminate practices of indigo planters he lent his support to Indias native dyeing techniques and wrote a book on it Vanaspatiyon Nu Rang Handspun fabrics and natural dyes were seen as symbols of selfreliance during Indias independence movement Currently with the fashion industry turning to be the second major polluting industry in the world Mishra believes that it is the right time to rediscover natural dyes like indigo to move towards a more sustainable future\n\nFrom the past to the future\n\nThanks to the unrelenting efforts of experts like Larraona or Rajappa the ancient art of indigo dyeing is not lost to the next generation Rajappas own experimentation with natural dyes began with simple kitchen staples like turmeric and beets After years of dabbling with natural dyes she met her guru in Yellapa who belonged to a family of traditional indigo dyers from Anantapur district in the state of Andhra Pradesh 400km from Kongarappattu It took her five years of coaxing to persuade the master craftsman to teach her his trade When he agreed she chose not to just to watch him work she wanted to be drenched in the deep indigo rituals\n\nYellapa had about 100 vats and Rajappa went about learning every nuance  from burying the pots in packed earth to stabilise the temperature to feeding the vat with cassia tora seeds to speed up the fermentation process to refilling the indigo dyes\n\nWe need to treat the vat like a living organism it would take all of our senses to know when it is perfect From smell touch to even stirring sound one can perfect the art of indigo dyeing only with time Even if a vat goes wrong an artisan would know ways to fix it With patience you will be able to watch a vat transform nothingness into abundance she says And that experience is precisely what she wants to share with anyone willing to give in to the spirit of Indigo\n\nHaving conducted various natural dyeing workshops Rajappa says it is heartening to see the revival of indigo farming and dyeing in various pockets of India  from Puducherry to Vijayawada Rajasthan to Bengal\n\nShe believes it is the right time to relook at the indigenous knowledge of natural dyeing and use local ingredients to create sustainable dyes\n\nNature will never tire of surprising us with her colours she says",

                "Summary": "A potential limitation of largescale trials is that some of the nuance pertaining to sitespecific context can be lost during analysis This will be address by including local researchers from a range of sites across the three study countries\n\nThis study will be one of the first process evaluations of an adequately powered trial of a pragmatic lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitusprediabetes prevention in women with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM within resourceconstrained environments\n\nThe overall aim of this process evaluation is to evaluate and understand what worked and why during the implementation of the LIVING intervention In addition this study aims to provide additional information that will assist in the interpretation of the LIVING Study results This study will address this aim by\n\nAn essential component of the intervention involves taskshifting a strategy involving the redistribution of tasks among health workforce teams described elsewhere 16 Our implementation strategy reflects a withinsystem taskshifting approach whereby the intervention is delivered by auxiliary nurse midwives or their equivalent hereafter called facilitators in each participating hospital Facilitators will have undergone training and will be equipped with educational materials in local languages including a facilitator manual with a session guide for each group session\n\nThe intervention comprises of 4 facetoface group sessions 84 automated text or prerecorded voice messages a participant manual monthly phone calls and 2 intensification sessions in the event that weight goals are not achieved within 6 months of the commencement of the intervention The LIVING Study process evaluation conducted alongside the RCT will inform policy and decision makers about the reasons why and the mechanisms through which the intervention worked and whether the intervention is likely to be generalisable and scalable in realworld contexts\n\nThe Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes LIVING Study is a randomised controlled trial RCT of a lowintensity lifestyle modification programme tailored to women with GDM in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka The multiple interacting components of this complex intervention were informed by several successful studies in the prevention of T2DM and weight gain which have been described elsewhere 1114 The multicentre study is being undertaken over 60 months December 2015 to December 2020 15 A total of 1414 women with prior GDM will be recruited from a total of up to 24 hospitals in these three countries Women are recruited into the study in pregnancy to assess for GDM and 318 months postchildbirth if diagnosed with GDM in the index pregnancy to assess glycaemic status for eligibility to participate in the trial Women eligible for participation in the trial are therefore randomised to the control or intervention group 318 months after childbirth Women are excluded from the trial if travel time to hospital is greater than 2 hours a household mobile telephone is not available if steroids are used during pregnancy or if they are likely to move residence in the next 3 years Followup visits are conducted for all participants every 6 months from the data of randomisation The intervention is designed to take 4852 weeks from randomisation to have all of its components delivered Further detail on the inclusion and exclusion criteria the calculation of the number of subjects and how they will be recruited is in the main trial protocol 15 The primary outcome of the randomised trial is the proportion of women with a change of glycaemic category at or prior to the final visit 1 normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose IFG or impaired glucose tolerance IGT or T2DM and 2 IFG or IGT to T2DM The secondary outcomes of the study include change in body weight waist circumference blood pressure fasting blood glucose physical activity level and diet 15 The main trial outcomes will not be analysed in the process evaluation However we will present figures related to the study processes for example duration between childbirth and glycaemic status assessment duration of the intervention and intervals between followup visits\n\nIn India up to 25 of the 25 million pregnancies occurring each year are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM and this proportion is rapidly increasing 13 Prevalence estimates using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups in Sri Lanka 23 are similar and in Bangladesh 10 are somewhat lower 4 5 Prior GDM is an established risk factor for the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 6 Systematic review evidence using international and specified local criteria indicates a sevenfold greater risk for T2DM conversion in women with GDM compared with normoglycaemic pregnancies 7 Further 3560 of Indian women with GDM will develop T2DM or prediabetes within 5 years of childbirth more than double the rate observed in largely White populations 811 Onset of T2DM is preventable or can be delayed through sustained changes to diet exercise and selfcare proactively engaging in activities to preserve and improve health Yet to date there have been no completed adequately powered trials of interventions to demonstrate such an effect in South Asian women\n\nMethods and analysis\n\nPatient and public involvement Patients were involved in the design and conduct of this research The LIVING intervention builds on the prior HeLPher and PregDiabCare Programmes17 18 HeLPher is a lowintensity lifestyle programme designed to prevent persistent postpartum weight gain among ethnically diverse Australian women Key features of this programme include nonprescriptive simple health messages small changes to behaviour low participant burden and intervention delivery including a mix of group sessions phone and short message service text reminders The intervention was associated with a significant weight difference 1 kg between intervention and control groups favouring the former PregDiabCare comprised of only six group sessions focused on diet and physical activity with implementation in two Indian hospitals providing with preliminary evidence of feasibility and effectiveness Building on these prior interventions the LIVING Programme was developed through a process of formative research The formative research was conducted in two hospitals in each of North and South India Bangladesh and one from Sri Lanka and included document analysis process mapping semistructured interviews and focus group discussions with all key stakeholders healthcare providers patients and advisers to policymakers We used these data from this formative research and the theoretical models described above to identify which barriers and enablers needed to be addressed as well as what modifications and combinations of HeLPher and PregDiabCare would be most likely to target such barriers and facilitators The UK Medical Research Council MRC provides guidance on implementing and evaluating complex interventions The guidelines advocate for the use of theory in order to explain specific elements of the intervention and the avenues through which it may work Contributors to MRC guidance contend that this is vital to building an evidence base that informs policy and practice19 20\n\nMethodological approaches informing our evaluation framework The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance REAIM framework will be used to inform the LIVING Studys process evaluation framework21 The REAIM framework consists of five dimensions of healthrelated behaviour interventions reach to the target population effectiveness of the intervention adoption by the intended recipients of the intervention staff and institutions such as hospitals implementation including consistency of implementation and costs and maintenance of the intervention effects in specific settings over time19 These five dimensions aim to encourage researchers evaluators and policymakers to identify the elements of health interventions that improve adoption implementation and sustainability The REAIM framework was considered highly suitable as the LIVING Programme was designed with the intention of broader adoption and implementation into policy and practice in the South Asian context and has been used to design our evaluation framework figure 1 Figure 1 Process Evaluation Framework for the LIVING intervention to prevent or delay or delay

guide the design of our qualitative tools eg semistructured discussion schedules within the overall evaluation framework figure 122 23 Table 1 Data collection tools and frameworks used to address process evaluation objectives The LIVING intervention has been designed to build the capacity and motivation of women to make small achievable changes to their lifestyle Thus we required a theory that would take a complex multilayered approach to understanding individuals behaviour change and ideally leverage the strengths and address the limitations of a plethora of other behaviour change frameworks22 Michies Theory is ideal in this regard as it consolidates key behaviour change frameworks and includes a Capability Opportunity MotivationBehaviour COMB Model Capability investigates individuals physical and psychological capability This includes knowledge skills and tools Opportunity refers to the social and physical opportunities available to the individual to perform a behaviour Motivation refers to the level of motivation as well as unconscious habits and conscious thoughts and goals that influence behaviour in reflective and automatic ways The behaviour component looks at the type of behaviour sought which is shaped by capability opportunity and motivation These sources of behaviour are positioned within a wheel with the outer layers acknowledging the influence of intervention functions eg enablement training persuasion and education and policy categories eg guidelines fiscal measures and legislation However the limitation of Michies Behaviour Change Theory is that it is best suited to individual behaviour change rather than organisational change The third objective of this process evaluation is to evaluate whether the intervention is scalable and sustainable within a realworld setting Thus we required a conceptual framework to understand how the LIVING interventions withinsystem taskshifting and new ways of organising and delivering healthcare would be adopted implemented and practised NPT is ideal as it is targeted at understanding the collective action and organisational behaviour required to introduce complex interventions to healthcare settings The theory uses four constructs representing the work involved in establishing a new practice coherence cognitive participation collective action and reflexive monitoring Coherence refers to the sensemaking work people undertake as individuals and collectively in order to operationalise new practices Cognitive participation is the relational work done to sustain a community of practice from introducing a new practice called the initiation phase to defining the actions and procedures required to sustain a practice called activation Collective action refers to the operational work done to enact a set of practices eg considering workability and context Reflexive monitoring is the appraisal work people do to assess and understand how new practices affect them and others around them23 NPT will be used to inform the semistructured interviews with service providers eg health workers and management staff Together the two theoretical frameworks will allow the research team to study the specific causal mechanisms through which the intervention seeks to make change as well as the extent to which it is effective and acceptable adopted by healthcare organisations implemented as intended and has the capacity to be scaled up and sustained see figure 1 for evaluation framework\n\nThe LIVING Study process evaluation framework The evaluation framework figure 1 demonstrates each of the intervention components and the relationships among them First the framework incorporates the intervention components addressing assumed causal mechanisms These causal mechanisms explained in detail in our logic model figure 2 are intended to make it easier to understand why the intervention will work and to facilitate external scrutiny of their plausibility These assumptions are underpinned by the key elements of Michies Behaviour Change Theory and COMB model capability opportunity and motivation Thus it also serves to test the applicability and robustness of the theory in the context of lifestyle change in women with prior GDM in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Second the framework incorporates implementation factors eg reach and recruitment fidelity and dose as well as adoption and implementation mechanisms of impact eg effectiveness acceptability and maintenance and finally the outcomes of the trial to be assessed at the end of the study Figure 2 Logic model for the LIVING intervention to prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM in women with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM LIVING Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes A mixedmethods design will be used to investigate the components of our process evaluation framework This will involve the integration of both qualitative and quantitative data in the research process including evaluation datasets administratively collected process data accessed during monitoring visits check lists and logs filled at intervention sites audit reports quantitative participant evaluation surveys semistructured interviews and focus group discussions Evaluation datasets data from participants will be collected at randomisation and 6 monthly intervals thereafter with oral glucose tolerance tests and HbA1c tests alternately conducted at the followup 6 monthly visits and both tests at the endofstudy visit These assessments will include anthropometry as well as surveys of physical activity and diet using validated questionnaires Administrative data data indicating eligibility and reasons for ineligibility will be used to assess generalisability of the intervention Monitoring at least one every 6 months will be conducted by central study staff to ensure compliance with the protocol and any local requirements During each visit the study monitors will fill in a monitoring report on record maintenance conduct of sessions and implementation of the programme and offer feedback to ensure consistency of the implementation The voicetext messaging report will indicate the number of successful messages sent every month as well as whether the voice message was heard completely or disconnected early Programme checklists and logbooks programmespecific checklists were developed in conjunction with the research team records to assess implementation fidelity recruitment intervention delivery and programme context Intervention session logs documenting attendance collection of feedback and participation of group members will also be analysed Programme auditing the delivery of the group sessions will be audited by direct observation remote observation or audio or video recording These data will be analysed alongside the intervention session logs and checklists All four sessions will be observed for the first group at each site and one of any of the four sessions will be observed for all group sessions thereafter Quantitative participant evaluation survey a barriers and facilitators evaluation survey administered after the fourth and final group session at approximately 6 months after randomisation will be undertaken to explore what women have found to be enabling and what challenging in executing lifestyle modification following the group sessions Surveys will list potential barriers to physical activity and healthy eating as well as facilitators Survey items are informed by the formative research as well as findings from previously conducted diabetes prevention programmes Participants will also be able to mention barriers and enablers that are not listed in the evaluation form Semistructured interviews and group discussions semistructured interviews and group discussions will be conducted with a subgroup of participants allocated to the intervention arm of the RCT staff and stakeholders at the end of the study Interviews will also be conducted using a maximum variation sampling technique to ensure that diverse opinions are gained from healthcare workers hospital administrators and representatives of relevant government agencies with broad representation across the three countries Group session evaluation form all women who attend group sessions will fill out a feedback form at the end of each session They will score their overall experience of the intervention session including feedback on intervention content its presentation as well as the facilitators skills and behaviour In table 1 above we describe how each of the data collection tools listed within the evaluation framework will be used\n\nEvaluating whether and how the intervention had impact for whom and why Surveys The barriers and facilitators evaluation survey online supplemental appendix A and group session evaluation form online supplemental appendix B will help us understand what aspects of womens lives including their living conditions structural issues and level of support available are preventing them from achieving changes and which aspects of the intervention they found useful for example selfmotivation scheduling social support and information Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp001pdf Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp002pdf The group session evaluation form will explore whether the topics covered in the sessions were relevant to participants whether they felt that the trainer was well prepared whether the time allotted for the session was sufficient and whether the content was organised and easy to follow Evaluation datasets These data will be used to quantitatively evaluate effectiveness eg percent change in outcome variables at the end of the trial These data will be used to compare characteristics of intensification and nonintensification participants to identify any trends in whom the intervention was most effective or least effective for Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions Semistructured interviews see online supplemental appendix C for interview schedule and focus group discussions see online supplemental appendix D for discussion schedule will seek to gain a deeper understanding of the themes underpinning the surveys described above From the interviews we expect to understand participants individual experiences of the intervention while focus groups will be used to understand the similarities and differences in womens experiences In addition they will seek to address its gaps eg themes that participants raise in the surveys that were not listed by intervention developers in the preformulated survey tool These data will contribute to a deeper understanding of what participants and the health workers delivering the intervention think the causal mechanisms are as well as their general attitudes towards the intervention The discussions will include a specific focus on how from the perspectives of the participants and the health workers the intervention impacts elements of Michies Behaviour Change Theory that is womens capability opportunity and motivation Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp003pdf Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp004pdf\n\nEvaluating whether the trial was implemented appropriately and as planned In order to investigate the fidelity of the trial that is whether the components of the trial were delivered as intended and in appropriate detail this process evaluation will use mixed methods Routine monitoring data eg estimated number exposed to recruitment percent screened for eligibility percent ineligible for participation actual number eligible and actual number who participated and evaluation datasets will be used to assess reach whether the intended audience came into contact with the intervention and how To assess implementation and whether poor implementation limited the effects of the intervention we will use trial administration data including the actual number of phone calls text messages received and sessions attended The group session observation checklist online supplemental appendix E data obtained from programme auditing as well as other administrative data collection tools mentioned above will assess the management of group dynamics the transmission and emphasis of key messages the provision of all intervention materials and the participation of the group members Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp005pdf In addition pretraining and posttraining assessment of facilitators will be undertaken to evaluate their training and all facilitators will participate in a selfassessment wheel We will use these data to understand how facilitators carried out their roles and responsibilities These data will be supplemented with semistructured interviews and group discussions with participants and facilitators The discussions will seek to understand from various perspectives issues of fidelity and dose see online supplemental appendices C and D for discussion schedules\n\nEvaluating whether the results of the study are generalisable scalable and sustainable A third objective of this process evaluation will be to ascertain whether the intervention is generalisable and scalable Our theoretical framework will allow researchers evaluators and policymakers to pinpoint how the intervention with reference to the key components of each theory incorporated into our framework can be scaled up in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well as tailored to other contexts Focus groups and semistructured interviews will be used to understand the barriers and enablers to implementation In addition they will seek to understand how the complex intervention was embedded in organisational contexts as the result of individual and collective work to implement the programme We will investigate the extent to which the integration of the programme achieved coherence cognitive participation collective action and reflexive monitoring as well as how it might be expected that this will continue in the future and in other contexts Finally using semistructured interviews with key stakeholders in decisionmaking and management we will enquire about the extent to which current guidelines environmental social planning fiscal measures and legislation regulation and service provision are conducive to the scaleup and sustainability of the intervention at each site\n\nSampling Participants for the interviews and group discussions will be recruited using maximum variation purposive sampling Of the 1414 women diagnosed with GDM recruited for the study approximately half will receive the intervention All data collection methods listed above with the exception of the interviews and focus group discussions will involve women in the intervention arm of the trial For interviews and focus group discussions 6080 women with GDM including those that were due to receive the intervention but did not attend any sessions will be recruited at each of the sites in the North India South India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka regions to participate in the process evaluation Evaluation data session feedback and data from the barriers and facilitators survey will be obtained from each of the participants in the intervention For the semistructured interviews we will recruit 10 women from each of the four regions arriving at a total of 40 participants We will also recruit a facilitator site investigator project and hospital management staff and policymaker from each of the four regions totalling 20 interview participants For the focus group discussions with participants we will recruit five women from each of the four regions arriving at a total of 20 participants In total we will recruit 6080 interview and focus group discussion participants We anticipate that this sample size will be sufficient to achieve thematic saturation based on previous GDM studies In the event that thematic saturation has not been reached we will increase our sample of participants Participants will be recruited by the local site staff and where relevant reasons for not participating will be elicited Written consent will be obtained for the interviews and group discussions\n\nAnalysis plan The quantitative data collected as part of this process evaluation will include checklists logs and feedback surveys Descriptive statistics will be generated for these data The study outcome data including change in glycaemic status weight waist circumference diet and physical activity will be analysed in the main trial15 All interviews and group discussions will be audio recorded and transcribed We will undertake thematic analysis of all qualitative data moving from codes to categories and finally themes24 Data analysis will be conducted contemporaneously with data collection until thematic saturation has been achieved The development of the coding framework will be informed by the REAIM framework as well as the two theories Michies Behaviour Change Theory and NPT that have informed our interview and discussion schedules The analysis team JS LKJ DK and DP and their research assistants will consist of public health researchers with experience working in the South Asian region from nutrition health and legal backgrounds Members of the analysis team have been trained within institutions The George Institute for Global Health and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences with extensive experience in undertaking process evaluations alongside RCTs developing and monitoring internal research practices that meet the highest standards of research integrity and ethics The analysts will establish themes under the headings of the evaluation framework context causal mechanisms implementation mechanisms of impact and outcomes Given that the process evaluation is testing a hypothesised causal pathway described in the logic modelfigure 2 the analysis will aim to scrutinise the extent to which our logic model predicted the actual impact of the intervention and also identify unexpected mechanisms To triangulate data the analysis team will engage in constant iterative comparison among data from various stakeholders eg auxiliary nurse midwives participants and management staff Our analysis will identify components of the intervention implementation and outcomes associated with a large degree of agreement as well as identify any differences in experiences and perspectives among stakeholders Data from other sources listed in the framework including administratively collected process data and survey data will be used to triangulate themes Quantitative data will help inform fidelity and dose as described in the previous section The framework will aid in triangulating qualitative and quantitative findings as well as identifying the relationships among context implementation mechanisms of impact and outcomes Data analyses will be ongoing and process data will be analysed independently of the outcome evaluation data before the two sets of data are combined Data will also be triangulated to increase the reliability of results using the multiple perspectives of analysts based in India Bangladesh Sri Lanka and Australia and the diverse disciplinary social sciences medical legal and cultural backgrounds of the analysts In addition at least one analyst JS has not been involved in the development of the intervention and as such we anticipate that this independent perspective will help to triangulate data and ensure the reliability of our results\n\nStrengths and limitations A major strength of this study is that it will be one of the first process evaluations of an adequately powered trial of a pragmatic lifestyle intervention for T2DMprediabetes in women with GDM within resourceconstrained environments In addition the evaluation will be conducted from the perspectives of women participants facilitators site investigators and project management staff using two highly complementary theories Michies Behaviour Change Theory and NPT A potential limitation of large scale trials is that some of the nuance pertaining to contextual factors language cultural norms and site specifics may be lost during analysis and data management These limitations will be address by involving local researchers from a variety of sites across the three study countries during different periods of the study to enhance the reliability of the findings An additional limitation is that women participating in the process evaluation will be recruited by facilitators at each study site which may result in selection bias In addition an unintended consequence of our interview schedules being theoryinformed may be that we miss factors eg other than capability opportunity and motivation impacting participants ability to make changes to their lifestyle We will address this by including openended questions\n\nEthics and dissemination All participants in discussions related to the process evaluation will be given information about the study and their consent obtained Ethics approval to conduct this research has been obtained from the University of Sydney New South Wales Australia Additional sitespecific ethics approval has been at each local site in the three countries India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka This includes

                "Summary": "They say sales and distribution SD is a game meant only for big FMCG companies But with several challenger brands coming to the fore and making it big in ecommerce smaller brands have realised that physical retail business simply cannot be ignored in India\n\n\n\n\n\nAnKa SumMor founded by Ashok George and Rajiv Joshi in 2015 provides challenger brands the combined power of a large brand\n\nOur SD platform is for multiple challenger brands thereby solving their SD challenges of scale information and intelligence to optimally cater to demand at a reduced cost For this brands have to realise that not conventional distribution margin but their overall SD costs should be the benchmark This platform will help significantly reduce SD cost Also this notion of control needs to be questioned What use is control without information and intelligence remarks Rajiv\n\nThe startup is a single SD partner platform for brands in a city servicing all relevant retail channelsoutlets The platform services upcountry subdistributors eliminating the need for carrying and forwarding agents The challenger brands directly supply to AnKa SumMor warehouses resulting in lower logistics costs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frontline sales team on AnKa SumMor works with various brands and eliminates the challenges of deploying managing and retaining teams independently The platform claims to help brands with transparent order and sales information at any retail outlet level and in the process help plan the secondary sales for the brand The platform improves order fill rates and lowers market expiries in six months\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in revenue doubling in nine to 12 months and there would be no trade scheme leakage there will also be a reduction of SD costs up to 50 percent says Ashok George\n\nThe early days\n\nThe founders have known each other for over 20 years now and have worked together at CocaCola and Mother Dairy in the past The duo has a combined experience of over five decades in the SD and logistics industry especially in the FMCG industry\n\n\n\n\n\nThe founders say the problem of finding managing and retaining distributors has been a constant challenge coupled with the complexity of deploying and managing a large frontline sales team\n\nIn spite of all the effort and investment the FMCG SD system was always about fulfilling brand growth goals We knew that in other parts of the world SD was a separate business For instance the CocaCola company does not bottle or distribute the brands directly but has anchor bottlers Mother Dairys strength came from its direct supplies to its booths which was not the case the moment the company had to supply to retail says Rajiv\n\nRajiv Joshi Cofounder AnKa SumMor\n\nThe existing FMCG SD system in India is multilayered and fragmented For instance even big brands like HUL Amul Britannia Nestle and ITC have multiple distributors in any large city This works for them as they have managed to create demand for their brands resulting in significant revenue for each distributor\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever these same brands struggle with their long tail as the SD system is geared to sell and distribute what sells Imagine the plight of the No 3 4 or 5 challenger FMCG brands in the category For one large distributors are not interested due to lower demand and this results in lower revenue lower working capital rotation and more importantly higher damage and expiry in the market visàvis the large brands Two small distributors do not make enough margin to support a salesman resulting in the brand having to deploy their own frontline sales teams and this becomes expensive Also lack of sufficient infrastructure and working capital to support growth coupled with a high rate of logistics and distributor attrition can lead to the brand being weakened and unable to compete with large brands\n\n\n\n\n\nSD costs for these challenger FMCG brands are two to three times that of a large brand leaving them with very little room to invest in the growth of the brand Moreover with all these costs challenger brands do not have any visibility on order and sales from distributors to retailers which results in trade scheme leakages and poor SKU assortment along with damages and expiry The brands future is decided by the distributor and frontline salesman a system that leads to the creation of large brands\n\n\n\n\n\nAll experiments in FMCG SD systems are limited to a Master Distributor and Sub Distributor model which works only for big brands\n\nNew brands did not want to be stuck in a system that was created by bigger brands They were willing to take a leap of faith so came onboard with AnKa SumMor and have now clearly seen the benefit says Rajiv\n\nThe business model\n\nThe platform was funded and incubated by Fireside Ventures\n\nThe biggest challenge was the high cost of operations stabilising endtoend sales force automation sales projections and creating trust at retail during the first year where the scale was still low for the infrastructure and resources deployed says Ashok George\n\n\n\n\n\nAnKa SumMor has an inventory and working capital SD Model where ownership of stocks move to AnKa SumMor Their revenues are sales to retail and they get SD margins on the same Since the startup buys a stock at a discounted rate the discounts become their margins\n\nAll infrastructure for storage and delivery is hired and fixed manpower is on company roles Since most of the operating costs are fixed to semivariable revenue scale coupled with productivity enhancing technology will bring down operating cost as a percentage of revenue says Rajiv\n\nThe founders have invested over Rs 20 lakh in building the business from scratch The startup has raised Rs 6 crore in a Seed round from Fireside Ventures It has big plans over the next 18 months\n\n\n\n\n\nWe intend to raise Rs 13 crore in a combination of equity and debt during this year to fund our expansion to Bengaluru in early 2021 and increase infrastructure at Hyderabad and Chennai The goal is to service 15000 relevant outlets in these three cities by March 2022 We want to be profitable and generate Rs 100 crore revenue over the next two years Subsequently we want to raise Rs 100 crore to expand to the other metros and Tier I cities in India with a distribution reach of 100000 relevant outlets and plan to become a pan India operation in FY 2025 says Rajiv\n\nAshok George Cofounder of AnKa SumMor\n\nHe adds the startup will be further investing in deploying technology tools to automate warehouse and delivery operation and build an inhouse data analytics engine This will help create a recommendation engine to improve productivity at all levels and impact revenue growth for our brand partners besides reducing operating costs and improving profitability\n\n\n\n\n\nThe startup will continue to provide market insights for brands to leverage while developing consumer connectdemand for their customers by providing them data for hyper local marketing activities It will add merchandising and promoter services to become a complete Go to Market solution for challenger brands It will also create regional storage and logistics hubs for brand partners to improve stock rotation and lower logistics cost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brand currently directly services 2100 outlets in Hyderabad and Chennai and service over 20 subdistributors in Telangana and Chennai They intend to expand their reach to 5000 outlets in Hyderabad and Chennai by March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nThe startups revenues was Rs 18 crore in 2020 and is expecting to close FY 2021 at Rs 24 crore The company competes with Mobisy Technologies and JumboTail Avendus predicts that D2C brands will have a 100 billion market by 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are nearly 600 D2C brands in India and with the support of platforms like AnKa SumMor these brands will see massive growth in the coming years",

post with your colleagues friends and family to help us grow \n\nIn India close to 76 of the people in workforce are working without any employment contract And approximately half of these are daily wage earners earning anywhere between 150 INR 2  to 1000 INR 135  per day Hence unlike the more fortunate ones they buy products of daily use food items toiletries etc very frequently either daily or after every 23 days And to reach to this underserved customer base FMCG companies introduced sachets A daily wage earner cannot afford to spend 300 INR 4  on a bottle of shampoo but can buy a 2 INR 25 cents sachet which would last him for 2 days And thats why almost every FMCG product in India toothpaste shampoos detergent hair oil and even coffee has a SKU which is sold in a sachet\n\nBut close to 40 years back most of these FMCG products were sold in large packets and bottles Hence they were only limited to those who were well off There was no concept of sachets back then But a small entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu introduced the concept of sachets to the entire country forcing even the large MNCs to follow suit In the process he ended up building a 500 crores INR shampoo brand called Chik And today almost 70 of the shampoo sales in India happen in sachets\n\nChik Shampoo\n\nIn todays Simplanation we would go through the growth story of Chik its effective marketing and sales strategy\n\nThe Beginning of Chik\n\nIn 1978 Chinnikrishnan an agriculturist also ran a small pharmaceutical business in Cuddalore Tamil Nadu In an attempt to innovate packaging of products he created the concept of sachets First he packed talcum powder into small sachets and started selling them to nearby shops After sometime he also thought that liquid could also be packed in sachets And thats when he started selling shampoos in sachets as well His vision was to make affordable products which could be used by coolies rickshaw pullers and other daily wage earners But he couldnt market these products well He passed away in 1982\n\nThe small business was overtaken by his sons who started a small regional company called Velvette shampoo which sold its products in small parts of Tamil Nadu The youngest brother CK Ranganathan decided to part ways with the brothers in 1983 and started his own cosmetics business with savings of 15000 Rs He started manufacturing shampoo sachets in a small shed and hired two chemistry graduates to work on formulations He named the shampoo Chik priced at 075 INR which was affordable for even the poor daily wage earners His primary target was the south indian rural market In its first month Chik sold 20k sachets\n\nCK Ranganathan The founder of Chik shampoo source Google Images\n\nIn its second year of operations Chik became profitable and started gaining good traction After becoming a common name in the rural markets of TN the company shifted base to Chennai in 1989 and named itself Beauty cosmetics Pvt Ltd By then few other players like HUL and Godrej had also entered this segment but Chik was still much ahead of them in the sachet segment Unlike his family business which was slow to grow CK Ranganathan deployed multiple marketing and sales tactics which helped Chik become a famous brand in the state of Tamil Nadu\n\nMarketing and Sales strategy\n\nThe success of Chic shampoo lies solely in understanding the needs and behavior of their customers well And all their marketing strategies reflect a great empathy for their consumers\n\nFirstly to attract and educate rural customers a lot of whom had never used a shampoo in their life Chik sales staff started running free movie shows in the villages of southern states of India With limited access to any kind of entertainment these free shows drew huge crowds Between the movies they played ads and showed live demonstration of using a Chik shampoo They also gave free sachets to audience to try This helped them gain a great brand awareness to the extent that the name became synonymous with the shampoo category\n\nWith bigger FMCG players entering around 1988 Chik adopted an innovative scheme where a customer could return 5 sachets of any shampoo to a retailer and get a Chik Sachet free The scheme was later altered where they started giving a free shampoo in exchange of sachets of only Chik Shampoo The price sensitive customers started buying only Chik Shampoo Though the scheme was discontinued after 10 months the habit of the customers continued This scheme worked wonders for the company with sales almost doubling to 10 lacs sachets per month in just an years time The turnover crossed 1 crore INR in 1989\n\nIn 1990 the company launched two variants with floral fragrances rose and jasmine In the southern part of the country women typically decorate their hair with jasmine flowers This move again worked very well for Chic and they tripled their sales to 30 lac sachets per month by 1991 All these efforts bore fruit and Chic became the number one shampoo brand in South India\n\nExpanding to other parts of the country was a tougher challenge given that Chik was famous only in the southern part of the country So it wanted that the distributors push their products more to the wholesalers and retailers and the retailers display Chik in more prominent parts of the store and ask the customers to buy this new product Hence they started offering the distributors and retailers 12 extra margins compared to the competition The competition brands didnt want to give up on their margins and hence decided to stick to the older structure This helped Chic grow some good traction in other parts of the country as well By 1992 the annual revenue of the company had reached 12 crores INR\n\nIn 1998 the companys name was changed to Cavin Kare Cavin means beauty in Tamil from Beauty Cosmetics In 1998 the company had a market share of around 6 The shampoo sachets from most of the companies used to cost between 1 and 2 INR Basis the consumer research they found that still a good segment of customers were not buying shampoos because they found the price point costly So they launched a 050 INR shampoo in 1998 which became a blockbuster hit By 2003 Chik had become the second largest national brand in India with 22 market share just a little below HULs Clinic Plus The revenues had reached close to 200 crores INR by 2003\n\nPositioning Handicap\n\nChik was always known for being a low cost shampoo With more demand for premium shampoos like Sunsilk Dove etc Chik also tried to upgrade its positioning by launching Chik Satin as a premium product But given the associated brand image it was very difficult to extend the same into premium shampoos as well Hence the new product was a failure With this handicap of positioning Chiks growth plateaued and other brands started growing through premiumization One more trend that Chik couldnt catchup on was the introduction of anti dandruff shampoos which went on to become 25 of the total market size by 2011 Chik did not introduce any anti dandruff shampoo Chiks market share had gone down from 22 in 2003 to a mere 5 in 2011\n\nBut even today Chik is a famous brand in the rural parts of the country which made sachets so popular that almost every FMCG product has a sachet version today Today it clocks close to 500 crores INR in revenues every year  is the biggest brand of the 2000 crores INR Cavin Kare group Apart from the shampoo company launched some more interesting products like Spintz perfume sold in 10 INR bottle and Fairever cream with Kesar saffron which also became big hits Today the group has over 100 products in FB and personal care space Chik did manage to introduce sachets on a large scale making daily use products affordable for millions But at the same time these sachets have been one of the major causes for pollution of rivers and landfills And thats something that both the company and the society should have been thoughtful about\n\nOk before I finish I got to know one more interesting point that I never really noticed The per unit price per ml price in a shampoo sachet is always cheaper than the per unit price in a shampoo bottle And the same hold true for other products as well Ever thought why is that the case  Do share your thoughts in the comments \n\nREFERENCES",

                "Summary": "The covid19 pandemic has shown we as a country need a lot to improve For any government caring for the people of the country is the first job The poor and needy must be at the top of the priority list to ensure they have enough to survive a situation like Covid19 In the last few months migrant workers took a significant hit due to the lockdown followed by a substantial dip in the economy However the Government pulled up the sleeves at the right time and announced several packages to ensure relief for these workers\n\nAs per reports only 10 of the allocated funds for the Rural Development ministry under the MGNREGS scheme remain with 4 months to go for the end of the current financial year\n\nRecord high fund allocation and wage payments\n\nWhen the workers moved back to their native places the first thing that they needed was work This is where MGNREGS came into action The union government has allocated approximately Rs85000 crore for employment under the scheme out of which Rs77000 crores have already been spent Over Rs55000 crore were paid in the form of wages while the rest of the funds went to other costs including material and skilled wages over Rs19000 crore administration costs over Rs2400 crore and so on As per the reports generated by the Ministry of Rural Development of the Government of India 9815 of payments were made within 15 days which is much better compared to the previous years\n\nAs per stats provided by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nGuaranteed employment under MGNREGA\n\nPassed in 2005 the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MGNREGA mandates the provision of at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work The main objectives of the Act include a minimum of 100 days of unskilled manual work as guaranteed employment in a financial year ensuring social including strengthening the livelihood of poor and strengthening Panchayati Raj institutions The Act helps in rejuvenating the natural resource base of rural areas and creates a durable and productive rural asset base\n\nThe surge in employment demand under MGNREGA during Covid19 pandemic\n\nDuring the Covid19 pandemic the lockdown loss of employment migration of workers back to native states and other factors created a surge in employment demand under the MGNREGS A total of 1465 crore job cards were issued in the current financial year out of which 1406 crore workers are still active 1905 are among active workers from SC communities and 1579 active workers from ST communities\n\nOut of 1406 crore active workers 1905 are SC and 1579 are ST Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nSurge in persondays generated compared to previous years\n\nAs per the ministrys data so far 277 crore persondays have been generated under the scheme compared to 26562 crore persondays in the last financial year Since 201617 this financial year has generated the most persondays with over three months to go There are some sections where this year lacked as well In the financial year 202021 the percentage of women persondays created went down by approx 2 compared to the previous year\n\nPersondays generated this year has surpassed previous years numbers with 3 months to go Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nThere has been a sharp decline in the total number of households that have completed 100 days of wage employment In this yes over 2097000 households have completed the target compared to over 40 lakh households in the previous year and 52 lakh households in the year before However the inclusion of differentlyabled persons was much better this year with over 530000 workers included compared to over 463000 last year According to a nongovernment group of NGOs named People Action for Employment Guarantees NREGA tracker states like Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have to dip into their own funds to ensure timely payments to the workers The lowest number of households getting 100 days of employment was lowest in Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand\n\nAreas where the stats show decline compared to previous years Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nHindustan Times quoted Jharkhands rural development secretary Aradhana Patnaik as saying We have been stagnating at around 70 million persondays for the past three years But we have achieved 777 million persondays against the target of 80 million\n\nMore funds will be allocated when required\n\nOne of the major concerns that these stats depict is the lack of funds under MGNREGA for over three months left in the financial year The Government has ensured that more funds will be allocated for the scheme whenever required and the states will get their share on time As of now around 94 of funds are available out of the allocated funds The demand for employment under the scheme is decreasing slowly as the workers are returning to the cities\n\nHowever the government aims to provide them with employment at their native places to ensure they do not have to migrate for work There are several schemes such as Gareeb Kalyal Rojgar Abhiyan under which the state and union government is generating jobs for unskilled and skilled workers Under these schemes the government is also providing training to the workers to upscale their income in the coming months",

33 new deaths due to coronavirus disease Covid19 reported in Delhi on Sunday the total number of people who have lost their lives to the viral infection in the Capital crossed the 10000 mark  becoming only the fourth state in the country to do so\n\nAs of Sunday the infection has killed a total of 10014 people from the 607454 people infected so far according to government health bulletin\n\nThe grim landmark however comes at the time when the outbreak in the city appears to be under control for the third time Sundays new deaths were the lowest singleday fatalities reported in Delhi in 45 days or since October 29 when 27 new deaths were reported\n\nLos Angeles mayor sounds alarm on rising Covid19 deaths\n\nThe hospital bed occupancy is lowest in three months according to state health minister Satyendar Jain Of the total 18807 hospital beds earmarked for Covid patients in Delhi 4446 are occupied as on Sunday Delhi has the least case fatality ratio at 16 comparatively Ahmedabad is at 40 Mumbai at 38 Kolkata at 2 and Chennai at 18 Because of improved health infrastructure and continued monitoring of home isolation Delhi has been able to achieve 96 recovery rate Jain said in a tweet on Sunday\n\nIn absolute numbers however Delhi remains one of the worsthit regions in the country For every million residents the Capital has seen 505 people die from the viral infection  twice the national average 110 deaths per million population\n\nIndian defence forces to stock weapons ammo for 15day intense war\n\nDelhis case fatality rate CFR  the proportion of confirmed cases that have died due to the disease  is 165 significantly higher than the national CFR of 145 Among the major states only four  Punjab CFR of 317 Maharashtra 257 Gujarat 184 and West Bengal 174  have seen a higher proportion of those infected die from the disease\n\nOn average 53 people have lost their lives to Covid19 every day in the past week This is the lowest the sevenday average of deaths has been in 37 days since November 6 At the peak of the third wave which is currently ebbing 116 people were dying every day on average in Delhi for the week ending November 24 This was the highest death rate since midJune to be sure deaths in this period were artificially inflated as Delhi retrospectively added fatalities that had been erroneously not attributed to Covid19 according to the Delhi government Since then however as cases have declined deaths have been falling as well\n\nDelhi which was one of the earlier hot spots for Indias outbreak is the only region in the country that has seen three distinct waves of infections The first started in midJune and peaked when the sevenday average of daily cases touched around 3400 in the last week of June This receded by the end of July when it dropped to around 1000 daily cases The second wave started at the end of August rising until midSeptember when average daily cases touched 4174 for the week ending September 17 This again dropped to 2574 in the week ending October 9 before the onset of the third wave The third wave raged through October and November leading to the largest surge seen so far The sevenday average of new cases peaked on November 14 when it touched 7341  the highest recorded so far Since then however cases have started receding almost steadily\n\nA Delhi government spokesperson said The people of Delhi have fought a courageous fight against Corona over the last 9 months At 165 Delhis fatality rate is the lowest among all large cities in India The credit goes entirely to our Corona warriors  our doctors nurses paramedics and all health officials who have worked day and night over the last 9 months to save countless lives\n\nExperts say that Delhis low hospital occupancy means that better care can be provided to patients that are critical which means that the number of deaths may remain low in the coming weeks\n\nThe number of deaths recorded per day is slowly going down now And it should be seen with other parameters such as increased tests lower number of new cases surfacing each day and the low positivity rate Overall it shows that the situation has improved It is likely to witness further improvement in the weeks to come Low occupancy rate of hospital beds also reflects that number of severe cases which requires the patients to be hospitalised are decreasing Dr Jugal Kishore head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital said\n\nDelhi however remains one of the most fatal Covid19 regions in the country as experts attributed the relatively high CFR to factors like poor air quality which can worsen the impact of respiratory disease like Covid\n\nCompared to other metropolitan cities such as Mumbai Pune Chennai Bengaluru etc Delhi has a bad air quality problem which contributes to respiratory diseases This year the festive season which witnessed massive crowds across the city coincided with the bad airquality days That period also witnessed extremely high number of cases which eventually led to an increase in the death numbers Secondly Delhi also witnessed high number of cases arriving from other states Most such cases were severe and they arrived very late Such cases contributed to high death toll in the city But the situation seems much better now said Dr Lalit Kant former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper epaperhindustantimescom",

                "Summary": "Kailash Vijayvargiya BJP general secretary and partys West Bengal incharge\n\nThe confrontation between the BJPled Centre and TMCgoverned West Bengal government is likely to intensify in the coming days with the BJP keen on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee targeting the saffron party and inadvertently helping the party project itself as the main challenger Party leaders expect this to further diminish the Congress and the Left Front as potential challengers in the narrative before next years Assembly polls\n\nWhile the faceoff has been highpitched since before the Lok Sabha polls with pitched battles allegedly involving workers of the two parties and accusations from both sides of being attacked by the other it was cranked up a notch last week when BJP president J P Naddas convoy was attacked on the outskirts of Kolkata\n\nSources in BJP said the party wants the Centre to take action against officials who were seen as negligent in the attack They said the widely held view is that imposition of Presidents Rule for the collapsing law and order situation could boomerang and Banerjee could use it to draw public sympathy But they also said that the tension between BJP and TMC should remain as that could keep the BJP up in the perception battle against the states ruling party\n\nKailash Vijayvargiya BJP general secretary and partys West Bengal incharge told The Indian Express It is anarchy law and order has completely collapsed in the state and the ruling party has crossed all limits of democratic values and constitutional proprieties Its the fittest case for imposition of Presidents Rule\n\nExplained BJP wants a direct battle with TMC The political battle in West Bengal is now perceived as one between the TMC and the BJP This is exactly what the BJP wants  to make it a TMC versus BJP political battle in peoples minds and relegate to the sidelines the other two big players the Left Front and the Congress which are expected to contest the polls together The party wanted Mamata Banerjee and her party to target its leaders to create the narrative of a direct contest and the Centres decision to replace a mild Keshari Nath Tripathi as Governor with Jagdeep Dhankhar who has been on a warpath with the state government since taking charge is seen as having helped that\n\nFor BJP Vijayvargiya said the battle is only getting intensified We have decided to take it up with the people We will continue our fight no matter how much violence is unleashed on us After Naddajis visit Home Minister Amit Shah is coming later this week December 1920 and that will infuse more confidence among the workers he said\n\nOn demands for Presidents Rule a person involved in BJPs electioneering process in West Bengal said The Chief Minister will make a hue and cry over that and could create sympathy in favour of TMC So the BJP does not want that drastic step imposing Presidents Rule for the time being However we want action to be taken against officials so that the heat is on\n\nOther than the absence of a strong cadre to match that of TMC the fear factor has also been a hurdle for the BJP leadership to extract full commitment and hard work from the cadre party leaders said There is violence everywhere Our workers are getting attacked and killed Vijayvargiya said\n\nThere have been similar allegations against the

the union government to impose Presidents Rule in the state\n\nThe TMC supremo also lashed out at BJP for trying to convert West Bengal into riottorn Gujarat and accused the saffron party of creating a new religion of riot and hatred to serve its divisive politics\n\nReaching out to the politically crucial refugee population in the state she said they need not be afraid of the implementation of National Register of Citizens National Population Register or the Citizen Amendmengt Act as all the refugee colonies have been recognised by the West Bengal government\n\nIf BJP and the Centre think they can scare us by bringing in central forces and transferring state cadre officers they are wrong The Centre is summoning our officers Just think of it  she said at a rally here\n\nI dare the Centre to impose Presidents Rule in Bengal she added\n\nBanerjee a strident critic of the saffron party iterated that BJP national president J P Naddas convoy was not attacked in Diamond Harbour and wondered why convicted criminals were accompanying him\n\nContinuing her tirade against BJP Banerjee said No one wanted to hurt him Nadda or his convoy  Why were so many cars accompanying his convoy Why were convicted criminals accompanying him The goons who vandalised the bust of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in Kolkata last year were accompanying Nadda  People get infuriated when they see such goons roaming free\n\nTMC had dubbed as intimidatory the union home ministrys order for shifting three IPS officers from the state following the mob attack on Naddas convoy The West Bengal government will have the last word on releasing the police officers for central deputatation it had said\n\nA top West Bengal government official said on Saturday that a communication had been sent to the union home ministry conveying the states unwillingness to release the officers\n\nAiming to take the wind out of the sails of BJPs refugee outreach campaign she accused the saffron party of trying to befool them\n\nBJP is trying to befool the refugees of the state just like they had done with the people of the country before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls I want to assure everyone that no one needs to be afraid of the NRC NPR and CAA All the refugee colonies of the state have been recognised and regularised by the state cabinet All the refugees will get their land rights she said\n\nCalling the saffron party an outfit of dacoits and thieves Banerjee said the BJP to divert attention from its failures is pointing fingers at the TMC and levelling baseless allegations\n\nFor BJP everybody is a thief and they are saints The BJP is a party of dacoits and thievesit has sent dacoits from Chambal region to terrorise people of the state They are bringing in people from outside to terrorise Bengalis she said\n\nBanerjee has often called BJP a party of outsiders\n\nReferring to a recent letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on changing the national anthem Banerjee said the people of the state will give BJP a befitting reply if it goes ahead with such a misadventure\n\nThey NDA govt want to change the history of our country and now the national anthem Bengal will give a befitting reply if they try to change the national anthem she said\n\nReferring to the longpending issue of a separate Gorkhaland state Banerjee said the BJP will never provide a permanent solution to the problems of the Darjeeling hills\n\nOnly TMC can do that\n\nShe said It is good that Bimal Gurung and his followers have understood that BJP was fooling them for the last 15 years Whenever election comes it talks about Gorkhaland and Darjeeling but does nothing\n\nI had never spoken about Gorkhaland But I can assure you that only TMC can provide a permanent political solution to the problem of the hills The BJP can never do that nor is it interested in it the chief minister said\n\nIn October fugitive GJM leader Bimal Gurung had quit the BJPled NDA and joined hands with the TMC This has provided TMC with the much needed political heft in the north Bengal region where the ruling party failed to open its account in the eight Lok Sabha seats in the last parliamentary polls\n\nBJP had made deep inroads in the region and bagged seven out of the eight seats\n\nShe urged the voters of north Bengal which has 54 assembly seats spread across seven districts to give a mandate against the outsider BJP and said it is trying to destroy the state with its divisive politics\n\nHow come BJP which came from outside won all the seats What was our fault in the last ten years The RSS and BJP are trying to take control over Bengal for their vested interest They are not real Hindus They are not Ramakrishna or Vivekananda they only spread hatred the feisty TMC supremo said\n\nReaching out to the SC and ST communities of the region Banerjee said the state government has introduced schemes to provide monthly pensions to those above 60 years\n\nIn a stern message to detractors in TMC Banerjee said she will not tolerate antiparty activities and attempts to weaken ot before the assembly polls due in AprilMay 2021\n\nThose who have enjoyed all benefits for the last ten years and are now trying to weaken the party will not be tolerated she said\n\nParty heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari gave up cabinet portfolios amid speculations over him

farm laws even as thousands of others intensified their nationwide pushback against the legislations reported ANI\n\nThe delegation comprising farmers from Uttar Pradesh Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Bihar and Haryana were associated with the All India Kisan Coordination Committee\n\nIn a memorandum submitted to Tomar the group claimed that some elements of the farmers community especially in Delhi were trying to create misunderstandings about the new reforms which propose to overhaul the way farmers do business in the country\n\nThe dawn of freedom that is visible after our untiring efforts and long struggle some elements are trying to create misunderstanding among farmers to turn it into dark night the memorandum stated To fulfil our responsibility towards crores of farmers of the country we have come from different parts of the country to meet you We have come here to show that farmers from different parts of the country are supporting these laws\n\nThe group said it has been an unhappy victim of the old market system We do not want that the same system of exploitation is imposed on farmers under any condition it said\n\nThe new farm laws among other things allows farmers to sell outside mandis notified by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee essentially eliminating agents who act as middlemen between the farmers and the governmentregulated wholesale markets A majority of farmers protesting against the legislations are against this as they feel these agents are essential to the agricultural economy and are their main source of credit\n\nThe memorandum urged the Narendra Modi government not to withdraw the three laws under the pressure of farmers agitation in some parts of the country Because if it happens farmers from different parts of

                "Summary": "In July 2012 former cricketerturnedpolitician Imran Khan described his vision for a Pakistani foreign policy on Twitter We stand for a nationalist foreign policy which envisages friendly relations with all on basis of reciprocity  in the interest of Pak he said in a social media post Khan was chair of the populist party Pakistan TehreekeInsaf which he founded in 1996 While his party placed third in general elections in 2013 losing not only to Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz but also to Asif Ali Zardaris centerleft Pakistan Peoples Party the elections solidified his status as an upandcoming political star\n\nSharif became prime minister and for the following four years until his eventual ouster by the Supreme Court as a result of the Panama Papers scandal was both an enthusiastic proponent of reviving Pakistans longstanding ties to China and a political punching bag for Khan\n\nKhan decisively won the top spot in Pakistans 2018 general elections following Sharifs fall from grace and the brief tenure of Sharif ally Shahid Khaqan Abbasi While Khan plays the populist card and tries to wrap himself as a champion of Pakistani nationalism and Islam his actions suggest the opposite By any objective standard Khan has surpassed Sharif in his willingness to subordinate and sellout Pakistani sovereignty to Chinese interests While Khan has lambasted Sharif and appears to despise him when it comes to China Khan is far more deferential to Beijing than Sharif ever was\n\nConsider the trackrecords of both premiers During Sharifs first term as prime minister 19901993 he visited China twice and convinced its leadership to assist with constructing the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex He returned to China for a week during his second term 19971999 shortly before Pakistan conducted a nuclear test a successful event to which Islamabad owed much to Beijing Just a month into his third term 20132017 Sharif returned to China and signed eight memorandums of understanding to develop a longterm plan for the ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor CPEC His rhetorical embrace of China was overthetop Our friendship is higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the deepest sea in the world and sweeter than honey he said Upon his return Sharif promised to set up a China cell in his office to supervise CPEC implementation and over the remainder of his term he hosted various implementation meetings for CPEC projects Khans nationalist criticism of Sharifs obsequiousness toward China ultimately led Pakistan to delay CPECs inauguration by several months but ultimately Xi Jinping came to Pakistan to sign fiftyone agreements worth 46 billion and formally start CPEC operations Subsequent deals only added to CPECs ambitions and value\n\nWhile many bilateral agreements begin with pomp but fade into the ether both Pakistan and China pushed ahead with their CPEC deals beginning work on several projects within the year and beginning trade over the new route in October 2016 Shortly before his dismissal Sharif returned to Beijing for a One Belt One Road conference He spoke in glowing terms about his China dealings saying the projects made winwin partnerships possible for all and promised the China deal would help in eradicating poverty in Pakistan and achieving sustainable development leaving no one behind Sartaj Aziz a prominent Sharif advisor bluntly stated that the China relationship was the cornerstone of our foreign policy\n\nOn July 28 2017 Pakistans Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from office on corruption charges It was a victory for Khan who was one of the main petitioners before the court and a frequent street agitator against Sharif who until the Panama Papers case appeared a shooin for reelection\n\nFor all of Khans nationalist and populist rhetoric however his legacy has been far more to lay Pakistan under Chinas heels He praised China in his victory speech and his early promises to review Sharifs dealings with China went nowhere Indeed while Abdul Razak Dawood Khans ministerialrank commerce and investment advisor at first explained The previous government did a bad job negotiating with China on CPECthey didnt do their homework correctly and didnt negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot Khan forced Dawood to backtrack on those comments and Khan quickly dispensed with his review and instead embraced the Sharif administrations formulation that China is the cornerstone of Pakistans foreign policy\n\nIndeed Khan quickly decamped to Beijing to beg for additional foreign assistance to offset a debt crisis in Pakistan and the following month acquiesced to a number of new Chinese projects in Pakistan involving the mining and mineral sectors as well as steel and petrochemicals In April 2019 Khan returned to Beijing and signed a number of new agreements\n\nKhan signed agreements to facilitate greater Chinese dominance within the Pakistani economy with little to suggest that impoverished Pakistanis especially in disputed areas like GilgitBaltistan would benefit He also blindly supported Chinas crackdown on Uyghur Muslims which highlighted the emptiness of Khans prior and subsequent fingerwaving on issues relating to the protection of Muslims and combating Islamophobia Likewise Khans government stifled an investigation into the sale of more than six hundred girls and women to China as brides\n\nKhans sycophancy only increased in the following months with Pakistani sovereignty becoming the primary victim Under Chinese pressure for example Khan created the CPEC Authority CPECA which enabled Beijing to bypass Pakistans National Assembly and Senate Khans administration also provided the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited COPHC which operates the Gwadar port with a twentythreeyear tax exemption Sharif and other opposition politicians labeled such concessions illegal under Pakistani law but Khan pushed ahead anyway in his efforts to appease Chinese interests And indeed such appeasement continued as in the past year Khan sold other concessions and assets to China While Khan has spoken about the relationship as a lifeline to the Pakistani economy the opposite is true While Pakistan exports 2 billion worth of goods to China it imports more than six times as much from China Cheap Chinese manufacturing and dumped goods continue to erode the Pakistani industrial base\n\nThat Pakistan should have relations with communist China is not the problem After all it was through Pakistans offices that Nixonera Ping Pong diplomacy and Secretary of State Henry Kissingers secret trip to Beijing became possible There is a qualitative difference however between maintaining good neighborly relations and the wholesale betrayal of both Pakistani sovereignty and given the ongoing genocide against the Uyghurs Islam as well Perhaps not since Vidkun Quisling has there been a politician who has so willingly and enthusiastically sold out his countrys sovereignty Sharif came close but Khan has surpassed even his example\n\nMichael Rubin is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a frequent author for the National

hightech superpower and the United States is humbled Americans have embraced communism and Manhattan draped with the hammerandsickle flags of the Peoples Union of America has become a quaint tourist precinct\n\nThis triumphant vision has resonated among Chinese\n\nThe scifi digital illustrations by the artist Fan Wennan caught fire on Chinese social media in recent months reflecting a resurgent nationalism Chinas authoritarian system proponents say is not just different from the Wests democracies it is also proving itself superior It is a longrunning theme but Chinas success against the pandemic has given it a sharp boost\n\nAlso read Why is Chinese colonisation a severe threat for foreign countries\n\nAmerica isnt that heavenly kingdom depicted since decades ago said Fan who is in his early 20s Theres nothing special about it If you have to say theres anything special about it now its how messed up it can be at times\n\nChinas Communist Party under its leader Xi Jinping has promoted the idea that the country is on a trajectory to power past Western rivals\n\nChina stamped out the coronavirus the messaging goes with a resolve beyond the reach of flailing Western democracies Beijing has rolled out homegrown vaccines to more than 1 million people despite the safety concerns of scientists Chinas economy has revived defying fears of a deep slump from the pandemic\n\nIn this fight against the pandemic there will be victorious powers and defeated ones Wang Xiangsui a retired Chinese senior colonel who teaches at a university in Beijing averred this month Were a victor power while the United States is still mired and I think may well become a defeated power\n\nAlso read How is CCP using United Front Work Department for its sinister agendas\n\nThe firm leadership of Xi and the party has earned China its recent success say newspapers television programs and social media\n\nTime to wake up from blind faith in the Western system said a commentary in the staterun China Education News last week Vicious partisan fighting has worsened in certain Western countries social fissures have deepened and a severe social crisis is brewing\n\nChinas current swaggering mood could add to the challenges facing Joe Biden when he takes office as president President Donald Trumps defeat in the election has done little to ease Chinese suspicion of the United States said Liu Jianqiu a businessman and online commentator in a telephone interview\n\nAlso read Two million members of Chinese Communist Party infiltrating worlds biggest companies Report\n\nI think China has gained the psychological edge said Liu in his 40s who described the pandemic as a turning point in his attitudes The performance of the West was completely out of my expectations and shifted my thinking even more  the facts prove that the American system really has no superiority\n\nCombative national pride surged in China in the runup to the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and after the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade Yugoslavia in 1999 Now there is a sharper sense that the Western powers are in perhaps irreversible decline and that the pandemic has confirmed Chinas ascent\n\nMost ordinary Chinese people previously were more admiring of the United States but in recent years the advantages of the Chinese system have become clearer to them said Jin Canrong an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing who has become a popular commentator under the nickname Commissar Jin Theres greater selfconfidence\n\nChinas diplomats and its staterun media have responded to criticism from Western governments with scornful disdain Chinese supporters of a more muscular foreign policy call for hitting back against Western critics especially in the wake of the pandemic\n\nLe Yucheng a Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs said in a speech last week that China was not spoiling for fights but he also warned other governments not to underestimate its resolve to push back against criticism\n\nFaced with this suppression and containment without scruples Le said well never swallow our pride or stoop to compromise\n\nOnline Chinese commentators have plumbed the depths of history to capture the current moment Some likened the United States to the crumbling British Empire of the last century overstretched and exhausted\n\nOthers are reaching back further comparing America to Chinas own Ming dynasty which crumbled in the 1600s under the weight of corruption insurrections and invasions In this view that spread online this year China should take the role of the barbarian Manchu armies who  in the commentators vivid notalwaysaccurate retelling  swept over the Asian steppes breached the Great Wall and crushed the Ming rulers\n\nModernday China must act like the Manchu forces advocates of the analogy say and prepare to break through a ring of geopolitical hostility by dominating vital seas around China\n\nGeremie R Barmé a Sinologist in New Zealand who has followed the rise of breakthrough studies  rùguānxué in Chinese  said the historical comparisons reflect anxiety about Chinas great nation status and its place in the world\n\nThe underpinning is that China is morally superior  we the Chinese people under the Communist Party  because we have none of the failings of America he said\n\nChinas leader Xi has not commented on the recent pronouncements of American decline But he sees China and the United States as locked in ideological rivalry Since coming to power in 2012 he has called for Chinese schools textbooks and websites to inoculate youth against Western values that could erode party rule and the countrys cultural selfconfidence\n\nOur schooling must never nurture wreckers or gravediggers of socialism Xi said in a speech in 2018 that was recently published in a book of his comments on ideology\n\nSome warn that China risks underestimating the strengths of the United States In recent months Chinese scholars have debated how Beijing should handle the postCOVID world with a good number urging restraint as the best way to win lasting influence\n\nChinas highvolume nationalism at home is making the United States feel that China is getting aggressive Xiao Gongqin a historian in Shanghai wrote in an essay that was published last month prompting wide discussion\n\nThe United States is far from the only country feeling the lash of official and public anger from China Australia has drawn Chinas ire for criticizing Beijing initiating laws aimed at reducing Chinese government influencebuilding efforts in Australia and urging an investigation into the origin of the pandemic  a touchy subject in Beijing\n\nLast month a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson tweeted a Chinese artists fabricated image of an Australian soldier poised to slit the throat of an Afghan child Australias prime minister Scott Morrison demanded an apology from China over the image which was a reference to an inquiry by the Australian military that found that its troops had unlawfully killed more than three dozen Afghan civilians\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry scoffed at Morrisons demand and the artist who created the image Fu Yu created another one mocking the Australian leader Fu who works under the name Wuhe Qilin had made a reputation with his scathing images of the United States as a bloodsoaked irrational medieval realm\n\nChinese values and American values are totally at odds Fu said late last month on a Chinese online talk show broadcast last week These values are in fundamental conflict",

West even if the rollout will take many months But for poorer countries the road will be far longer and rougher\n\nThe ambitious initiative known as COVAX created to ensure the entire world has access to COVID19 vaccines has secured only a fraction of the 2 billion doses it hopes to buy over the next year has yet to confirm any actual deals to ship out vaccines and is short on cash\n\nThe virus that has killed more than 16 million people has exposed vast inequities between countries as fragile health systems and smaller economies were often hit harder COVAX was set up by the World Health Organization vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI a global coalition to fight epidemics to avoid the international stampede for vaccines that has accompanied past outbreaks and would reinforce those imbalances\n\nBut now some experts say the chances that coronavirus shots will be shared fairly between rich nations and the rest are fading fast With vaccine supplies currently limited developed countries some of which helped fund the research with taxpayer money are under tremendous pressure to protect their own populations and are buying up shots Meanwhile some poorer countries that signed up to the initiative are looking for alternatives because of fears it wont deliver\n\nIts simple math said Arnaud Bernaert head of global health at the World Economic Forum Of the approximately 12 billion doses the pharmaceutical industry is expected to produce next year about 9 billion shots have already been reserved by rich countries COVAX has not secured enough doses and the way the situation may unfold is they will probably only get these doses fairly late\n\nTo date COVAXs only confirmed legally binding agreement is for up to 200 million doses though that includes an option to order several times that number of additional doses GAVI spokesman James Fulker said It has agreements for another 500 million vaccines but those are not legally binding\n\nThe 200 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India the company that will likely make a large portion of the coronavirus shots destined for the developing world CEO Adar Poonawalla says it has a confirmed order for 100 million doses each of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and one from Novovax\n\nWe dont have anything beyond that in writing he told The Associated Press If they want more theyll have to place more orders\n\nHe said the lack of commitment from COVAX will mean a much longer wait for people in developing countries Poonawalla also noted that his companys first priority would be making shots for India which has suggested it wants at least 300 million vaccines Its likely India would not be able to take all of those at once but a big order could delay the distribution of vaccines for other parts of the developing world Poonawalla said\n\nPotentially further slowing down the process is that neither the AstraZeneca vaccine nor the Novovax one has been licensed by any regulatory agency yet  and any injection distributed by COVAX will likely need WHO approval COVAX does not have any supplies of the two vaccines that appear to be most effective so far  the PfizerBioNTech shot and the Moderna one The United Kingdom has already begun giving the Pfizer vaccine and the United States and Canada are rolling it out this week Some Gulf countries have also authorized it\n\nStill GAVI said they aim to start rolling out safe and effective vaccines to COVAX member countries at scale within the first and second quarters of the New Year\n\nEven with vaccines in hand the rollouts will take many months even in rich countries and many developing ones are facing serious logistical challenges that will add to delays noted Dr Gagandeep Kang an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India\n\nEven senior officials at the WHO have acknowledged privately that attempts to fairly allocate vaccine through the initiative are flawed despite publicly lauding its success\n\nThe whole call for global solidarity has mostly been lost said Dr Katherine OBrien WHOs vaccines chief during a recent internal discussion a recording of which was obtained by the AP\n\nAsked to clarify her remarks OBrien said in an email that every country should have access to COVID19 vaccines as early as feasible\n\nAdding to COVAXs difficulties OBrien noted at a news conference this month that it was still 5 billion short to buy the doses its planning to obtain next year\n\nAccording to a report GAVI issued ahead of a meeting this week the alliance itself concluded that the risk COVAX will fail is very high saying it was established in record time and has to navigate unchartered territory\n\nBut John Nkengasong director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criticized Western countries for buying up the global vaccine supply in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX effort\n\nWith no certainty about which shots would work governments scrambled in recent months to sign multiple deals to ensure their citizens would have at least some COVID19 injections Canada for example bought nearly 200 million vaccines  enough to cover its population of 38 million about five times over\n\nNkengasong called the idea that people in rich countries would get immunized while Africans go without a moral issue\n\nBeyond the ethics experts note that failing to protect people in the developing world will leave a reservoir of coronavirus that could spark new outbreaks at any time\n\nAmid fears COVAX cant deliver some developing countries are pulling out entirely or seeking their own private deals Earlier this month the tiny Pacific island nation of Palau announced it was abandoning the initiative and would get donated vaccines from the US instead Other low and middleincome countries including Malaysia Peru and Bangladesh have stayed in the initiative but also recently inked their own deals with drugmakers as a Plan B\n\nAnban Pillay of the South African Ministry of Health said that joining COVAX was just a stopgap measure before signing bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies\n\nKate Elder vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders said its increasingly looking like the ship has sailed on equitable vaccine distribution  and GAVI WHO and others need to discuss how to increase vaccine manufacturing\n\nTo that end South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization to waive some provisions regulating intellectual property rights to make it easier for manufacturers in poor countries to make COVID19 drugs and vaccines But many rich countries are reluctant to do that\n\nAs more countries in the West authorize the vaccine the difference between people in rich countries getting vaccinated and the lack of any vaccines for the developing world will become quite stark said Anna Marriott health policy manager at Oxfam And it will only prolong the pandemic\n\nDisclaimer  This story has not been edited by The Sen Times staff and is autogenerated from news agency feeds Source Associated Press\n\nShare this

                "Summary": "The Maruti 800 is an icon in every sense and holds a special place in Indias automotive history The model was a gamechanger that brought the era of Japanese fourwheeled mobility to the masses in the country On December 14 2020 the Maruti 800 celebrates its 37th anniversary and while it may not be on sale anymore the car continues to be deeply a part of our collective conscience not to forget its still not too hard to spot one on the road As we celebrate 37 years of the iconic 800 here are seven facts that you need to know about Indias Peoples Car\n\nAlso Read The Iconic Maruti 800 Turns 35\n\nThe Maruti 800 was technologically advanced than its rivals at the time and also Indias first frontwheeldrive car\n\n1 The Maruti 800 was Indias first frontwheeldrive car\n\nThe very firstgeneration Maruti 800 was a big deal and a major departure from the popular Premier Padmini and the Hindustan Ambassador that were the more accessible cars available in 1983 It was also the first vehicle to get a frontwheeldrive setup in the country and was also more technologically advanced than its rivals at the time The Maruti 800 aimed to bridge the gap between the old and new bringing in far better reliability and a more frugal engine as well Maruti claimed fuel efficiency of 2595 kmpl on the 800 at the time of launch in 1983 T\n\nThe Maruti 800 SS80 was based on the Suzuki Fronte while the secondgen Alto based bodyshell was introduced in 1986\n\n2 The Maruti 800 started life as the Suzuki Fronte SS80\n\nThe original 800 was based on the Suzuki Fronte SS80 which was also the codename for the model in India A more modernised version with an aerodynamic bodyshell of the secondgeneration Alto SB308 was introduced in 1986 The first batch of the 800 was imported as a Completely Knocked Down CKD kit while the model was completely localised and built here for domestic and export markets\n\n3 The first Maruti 800 was priced at  47500\n\nThe Maruti 800 was pitched as the Peoples Car for India and was introduced at an accessible price of  47500 exshowroom A more premium variant with airconditioning was introduced in 1984 that was priced around  70000 About 15 per cent of the total cars produced were converted into the Deluxe variant with the HVAC unit In contrast the Ambassador and Padmini both were priced around  70000 exshowroom mark The aggressive pricing and easy ownership costs also made Indias middleclass sit up and take notice and flock to showrooms However purchasing an 800 wasnt as easy as it seemed\n\nThe then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi had handed over the keys to Harpal Singh the very first owner of the Maruti 800 in the country\n\n4 The waiting period stretched for years\n\nUnlike the easy accessibility today that we have for buying cars you couldnt just drive a Maruti 800 out of a showroom back in the 19801990s At the time of its announcement about 12 lakh people booked the car for a token amount of  10000 The initial models were allotted to customers based on a lottery system and the waiting period stretched by months and sometimes years together before you were finally handed over one Customers were willing to pay extra to get an allotment In fact the first car was awarded to Harpal Singh and the keys were famously handed over to the owner by Indias Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the time Interestingly Mr Singh owned the car throughout his lifetime\n\nAlso Read Indias First Maruti 800 Should Be A National Treasure Says Owners Family\n\nThe original Maruti 800 SS80 left with its successor the SB308\n\n5 Over 27 million Maruti 800s were sold in its lifetime\n\nThe firstgen 800 was codenamed the SS80 and was built with an initial investment of  269 crore The Maruti Udyog facility had assembled about 70 cars at the time of launch and could roll out one car in 800 minutes The plant had a production capacity of 20000 cars by 1984 which further increased to 40000 units by 1988 In just two years of the Maruti 800s launch the Indian passenger car market doubled in volumes from 40000 cars sold in a year to about 1 lakh units sold per annum By 1997 eight out of ten topselling cars in India was a Maruti\n\nMaruti 800 remains a pop culture icon and was the defacto first car for an entire generation\n\n6 Was sold in West Europe as a Maruti to bypass quota for Japanese cars\n\nMaruti began exports of the 800 in 1987 and the first set of cars were shipped to neighbouring countries followed by a batch of 500 cars to Hungary The Indiamade car was later introduced in the then Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia followed by other European markets soon after After tasting success in these markets Maruti decided to go for the more developed markets like France and the Netherlands in 1989 and 1990 respectively followed by England Italy and Malta In fact the cars sold here were specifically badged as Maruti to bypass the quota limit levied on Japanese cars All badges and references to Suzuki were removed right down to the owners manual to meet the same The Maruti 800 received seatbelts for the first time in 1987 to meet the export requirements and also the companys first catalytic converter to comply with European emission norms\n\nAlso Read From the Maruti 800 to the BMW i8 A Journey Of Auto Passion For Sachin Tendulkar\n\nA Firebrick Red Maruti 800 rolled out after final checks on January 18th 2014 after 31 years of production while sales stopped in February that year\n\n7 Maruti pulled the plug on the 800 in February 2014\n\nBy 2014 Maruti Suzuki was an auto giant and leader in the worlds thirdlargest auto market It had gone far beyond selling the 800 Meanwhile the Maruti 800 was finding it difficult to keep up with changing customer preferences That along with low volumes and the upgrade to BS4 emission regulations meant that meant we finally saw the automaker pull the plug on the muchloved product The final Maruti 800 rolled off the assembly line in February 2014 for a customer in Chandigarh bringing an end to a glorious era in Indian automobile history\n\nFor the latest auto news and reviews follow carandbikecom

                "Summary": " Provided by Hindustan Times\n\nSumptuous cricketing battles in Australia have effectively been about aggressive batsmen again fiery pace and the pinkball Test in Adelaide first up will add swing bowling to the equation Not an ideal setting for spin but that should only fire up the generations finest offspinners R Ashwin and Nathan Lyon\n\nAt 34 this Test series may be Ashwins last big opportunity to make an impact in Australia and on numbers overseas In 201819 he took six wickets in a day Test in Adelaide to help India go 10 but broke down to play no further part in a series that ended in a historic victory for India \n\nFitness apart Ashwin will need to convince the management he is the specialist tweaker they need in a pinkball game Lyon has been a Test regular for Australia thanks to consistency around the world And he averages a superb 2344 in the four pinkball Tests Australia have played and won at Adelaide\n\nVisiting spinners have struggled in DayNight Tests New Zealands Mitchell Santner leftarm 31 and Mark Craig offspinner 37 shared just three wickets while Pakistans Yasir Shah returned 0197 last year Fellow legspinner Tabraiz Shamsi of South Africa averaged 75 2150 Englands Moeen Ali didnt take a wicket 293990\n\nAlso Read  If I was a selector Id pick him Border Gavaskar pick Indias openers\n\nWhile Lyon is certain to play Ashwin has a modest overseas record And but for Ravindra Jadejas injury he would have to also contend with the latters better batting and electric fielding Hanuma Viharis parttime offspin too can tempt India to pick an extra seamer Ashwins challenge is clear\n\nStill the LyonAshwin rivalry is certain to emerge as the series unfolds The career of Lyon 32 has run parallel to Ashwins Their overall hauls are not far apart though Lyon has an advantage Flatter pitches and a kookaburra ball not great to grip are at his home turf Friendly subcontinent conditions are a bonus\n\nThere is little to separate in terms of overall numbers Lyon has 390 wickets in 96 Tests while Ashwin has a tally of 365 in 71 Lyon though has 191 scalps in 48 home Tests including 51 in 11 versus India\n\nAshwins early coach is confident he will have plans in place if picked for Adelaide On the 2018 England Test series at a seaming Edgbaston Ashwin bowled Alastair Cook cheaply in both innings This time Steve Smith a righthander unlike the retiring Cook looms as a far bigger threat\n\nAlso Read  Warne says he would pick Kuldeep ahead of Ashwin in Adelaide Test\n\nI want him to surprise the pundits surprise billions of others by getting a matchwinning spell says Sunil Subramaniam a former Tamil Nadu leftarm spinner who first noticed Ashwin at a state coaching camp and guided him\n\nDoing well in Adelaide will be crucial for Ashwin when Jadeja regains fitness But in seven Tests in Australia he has 27 wickets at an average of 4807 and a strike rate of 9478 For his 254 wickets at home he only has 111 away\n\nShivlal Yadav who was Indias main offspinner on the 198182 and 198586 tours of Australia says the key is to adapt\n\nTo succeed in Australia the basic thing is to flight the ball Flight and impart finger spin and you will get the same amount of help from the pitch The faster you bowl easier it is for the batsmen That is why S Venkatraghavan was not that successful in Australia while EAS Prasanna 31 wickets in 8 Tests always was and I did reasonably well said Yadav who took 23 wickets in five Tests in Australia\n\nAshwin was in good rhythm in IPL though a shoulder injury forced him to sit out some games Besides he has not always been the first choice In 201415 debutant legspinner Karn Sharma was chosen over him for the first Test After an indifferent show in the loss Ashwin was recalled and took 12 wickets at 4866 in three matches\n\nI dont think being inform or outofform would have a say in how he performs He can draw upon his experience intelligence The only thing would be injury as he has had them on recent tours said Subramaniam\n\nLyon is a more classical offspinnersideon semiopen and uses his body fully So he extracts more out of wickets that doesnt assist Ashwin is a fingerandhands bowler He is not much of a body bowler He makes up with his cerebral approach He uses the angle of delivery and the crease Both intrigue me If you are a connoisseur of spin bowling you would love to watch them go headtohead\n\nAccording to CricViz data Lyon imparts more spin on the ball His average deviation is 418 degrees to Ashwins 313 Lyon bowls fuller and probes outside offstump Ashwin prefers to attack the stumps middleandleg\n\nLyon is a brilliant spinner who has proved himself all over the world be it South Africa or India His action is so smooth that even if he bowls long spells he doesnt lack penetration says Yadav\n\nAt home Lyon exploits the bounce and aims for batpad catches With Virat Kohli flying home after the first Test his main challenge will be how he bowls to Cheteshwar Pujara The star of Indias 201819 campaign negated Lyon with two tacticsusing the feet to kill the turn and the pad to avoid batpad chances In 11 innings Lyon has dismissed Pujara four times His average against Pujara is 61 Lyon has a good record against vicecaptain Ajinkya Rahane removing him six times in 14 innings at an average of 3216\n\nCricViz statistics also show the Aussie bowls wider more often while extracting more turn with the kookaburra ball that does not have a pronounced seam like Indias SG make While 217 of Lyons deliveries are pitched wide only 114 of Ashwins deliveries adopt that line Just over 50 of their deliveries are on the offstump channel\n\nNumbers also show that Lyon pitches full more often 362 to 300 while Ashwin bowls a touch slower 866 kph to 874 kph\n\nSMITH CHALLENGE\n\nThe other side of the battle will be how Ashwin goes against Smith In an ominous sign for India Smith has run into great form in the ODIs His record against the Indian bowling is intimidating and the Australia No 3 has dominated Ashwin In the 14 innings they have faced off Smith has got out to him only thrice and he averages 116 348 runs off 570 balls against him\n\nThis week Ashwin was nominated for the International Cricket Council ICC Mens Player of the Decade award in a sevenplayer list He is the fastest Indian bowler to reach 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 wickets in terms of innings\n\nFor such a prolific performer making a mark overseas is yet to happen\n\nIf you look at the wickets we have played on for the last year or so the spinners role outside India is to hold one end up and contribute with the bat Jadeja has been doing that beautifully Ashwin I suspect would play the same role They cant do more than what traditional finger spinners can do\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper epaperhindustantimescom",

Rather it was the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 that attracted many from the mostly Orthodox community to emigrate and start a new life in the Jewish homeland\n\nFor Essie Sassoon a retired doctor of obstetrics and gynecology who initially went to Israel as a medical volunteer during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 one of the main reasons to stay on was family\n\nWhen my sister and her family left for Israel I felt that I didnt have any close relations left in India I was very attached to my sister she said It was a very difficult decision because I love India very much And I was in a very good position in India and I was progressing But it happened\n\nSome of Sassoons fondest memories revolve around her childhood spent celebrating the numerous Jewish traditions and festivities as an Orthodox Cochini Jew in this southern India port city\n\nFrom the blowing of the shofar inside the now 452yearold Paradesi Synagogue on Rosh Hashanah to the annual Simchat Torah celebrations  an

it\n\nAs a pluralistic democratic nation India has long been known as a refuge for communities facing oppression elsewhere The Paradesi and Malabari Jewish communities have always coexisted peacefully with Indians of other religions with zero traces of antiSemitism\n\nI have never felt discriminated against as a Jew living in India When I was studying at university they used to ask when the festival of the New Year that is Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  the fast  would be before they set the dates for public examinations Sassoon warmly remembers They wouldnt put exams on those dates because of Jewish students like me\n\nFor Kerala in particular the states deeply rooted syncretic multiculturalism can be traced back to antiquity when ancient traders of western Asia and India placed importance on preserving the identity of communities they traded between\n\nThe first real dent in Indias record of welcoming communities fleeing persecution came last year with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act which fasttracks citizenship to Sikh Hindu Buddhist or Jain refugees from neighboring countries but not Muslims Jews or atheists\n\nThe law is not expected to impact the few Jews who chose to remain in India\n\nThose who have immigrated to Israel are eligible for lifelong Overseas Citizen of India or OCI cards that have been easily available since 2017 thanks in part to current Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Israel\n\nThis is actually the first time Im hearing about it Sassoon said when asked about the amendment I personally have an OCI card that doesnt expire I dont need a visa if I want to go to India",

with Indians of other religions with zero traces of antiSemitism\n\nI have never felt discriminated against as a Jew living in India When I was studying at university they used to ask when the festival of the New Year that is Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  the fast  would be before they set the dates for public examinations Sassoon warmly remembers They wouldnt put exams on those dates because of Jewish students like me\n\nFor Kerala in particular the states deeply rooted syncretic multiculturalism can be traced back to antiquity when ancient traders of western Asia and India placed importance on preserving the identity of communities they traded between\n\nThe first real dent in Indias record of welcoming communities fleeing persecution came last year with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act which fasttracks citizenship to Sikh Hindu Buddhist or Jain refugees from neighboring countries but not Muslims Jews or atheists\n\nThe law is not expected to impact the few Jews who chose to remain in India\n\nThose who have immigrated to Israel are eligible for lifelong Overseas Citizen of India or OCI cards that have been easily available since 2017 thanks in part to current Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Israel\n\nThis is actually the first time Im hearing about it Sassoon said when asked about the amendment I personally have an OCI card that doesnt expire I dont need a visa if I want to go to India",

                "Summary": "It is not uncommon in India to see cattle grazing in farms and backyards ruminating by the road or even causing a minor inconvenience to vehicles Replace cattle with herds of gaur Indian bison and you are likely to be in Coonoor one of the taluks in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu\n\nIn Coonoor and the neighbouring taluk of Kotagiri gaurs come out of forests in herds and in many cases graze mate and sleep in the vast tea plantations They are soon becoming a tourist attraction in these hill stations otherwise known for the scenic landscape of emerald tea plantations interspersed with forest patches\n\nGaur Bos gaurus belongs to the family of wild oxen and is the tallest living and the second heaviest among oxen Considered the largest living bovine the body length of gaur is usually 250 cm to 360 cm with a height of 170 cm to 220 cm Males may weigh between 1000 kg to 1500 kg and females between 700 kg1000 kg\n\nIncluded in the Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 and listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List gaurs estimated population is around 13000 to 30000 in the world with approximately 85 of the population present in India In the south they are found abundantly in the WayanadMudumalaiBandipurNagarhole range A recent survey of the gaur population in the Nilgiris division of the Tamil Nadu forest department has put the population at 2000 in the division\n\nGaurs in places such as Coonoor and Kotagiri in Tamil Nadu and Kodagu in Karnataka are moving out of forests in herds to forage in farms Base map from Datawrapper\n\nGaurs leave forest make farms home\n\nThese large herbivores are being increasingly found outside protected areas Many gaurs have made farmlands of the Nilgiris district and the Kodagu district in Karnataka their home\n\nIn Kodagu where the forest is contiguous with coffee plantations they remain true to their shy nature and take to their heels at the first sign of human presence leaving trails of destruction in its wake Most of the times gaurs come into the estate at night says 55yearold coffee planter NB Krishnaraj of Nagarally village in Somwarpet taluk We rarely get to see it during the day Even if we spot one they take to their heels and sprint away They come in herds at night They mostly brush their horns against coffee shrubs and cause damage They also break the Dadap trees Erythrina subumbrans which coffee growers grow as a shade tree and eat their shoots\n\nBarring a few isolated freak accidents it is usually crop damages by gaurs that are reported from Kodagu In the Nilgiris however severe forest fragmentation has increased conflict between the gaurs and humans These conflicts mostly accidental have led to the loss of lives as well Records with the forest department Nilgiris forest division show that in the year 20182019 five human lives have been lost and 30 injuries reported from encounters with gaurs\n\nThey normally move about in the early mornings and evenings said district collector of the Nilgiris J Innocent Divya We have sensitised the local population to not venture out at these times if possible so there are no accidents Early mornings and late evenings are the time for these animals and other times are for human movement We have to do that to coexist with them\n\nA herd of gaur or the Indian bison in a tea plantation near a house in Coonoor Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nAt a 1200acre tea plantation in Coonoor the labourers claim there are at least 50 gaurs of multiple herds that have been residing in the tea estate for close to two decades The labourers who pick tea face the danger of getting too close to the gaur\n\nBut they are not scared and apply caution when needed Erumai gaurs do not do anything even if we go close to them We do our work maintaining a fair distance and they dont trouble us So I am not scared to work here said 50yearold tea picker Sivagami\n\nRecurrent crop damages caused by gaurs however infuriates some farmers but elephants leopards and bears cause much more damage to crops and lives District Forest Officer Nilgiris Division Guruswamy Dabbala says that human settlements are expanding in the district and so is the population of gaurs\n\nThey are now so habituated to human presence that they even walk into towns and markets he said They relish certain crops like beetroot which is proving to be a problem for farmers Casualties have happened and it is mostly the elderly women and labourers who find themselves in harms way\n\nA mosaic of farmlands and forests in Coorg Karnataka Fragmentation of habitats has been pushing the gaur into humandominated areas Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nGaurs are adaptable\n\nExtremely shy in nature it is in fact difficult to get close to a gaur in its natural habitat How they began to move out of the forests and into humandominated spaces and underwent tremendous behavioural changes to coexist with humans is baffling to the scientific community\n\nWhat facilitates their cohabitation with humans is perhaps their highly adaptable nature Shukla and Khare 1998 in their studies in Pench Wildlife Reserve Central India reported that gaur grazed and browsed on a much wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India It feeds on green grass young leaves and soft shoots during favourable forage conditions at the same time hardly discriminated between low and highquality food during severe seasons Another study titled Diet Composition and Quality in Indian bison based on Fecal Analysis said that gaur is an intermediate or adaptable mixed feeder with the ability to adapt to poorer diets when highquality food is in short supply such as in winter\n\nDiurnal in nature they become nocturnal in conflictprone areas said M Ashok Kumar a wildlife biologist at Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University who has done an extensive study on gaurs in Mudumalai National Park adjacent to the Nilgiris district in 2004 This shift from natural behaviour is now being observed in the Nilgiris as well as in Kodagu\n\nIn Kodagu gaurs venture into human habitations only at dusk and stay away from humans in the day whereas in Coonoor and Kotagiri where the tea plantation does not provide cover like coffee plantations they have overcome their shy nature to survive and coexist with humans all times of the day\n\nThe gaur and the signs of its presence on the streets of Coonoor and Kotagiri in Nilgiris Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nWhat pushed gaurs to leave the forest to navigate humandominated space Ecologist Raman Sukumar of Centre for Ecological Sciences Indian Institute of Science Bangalore points at various possible reasons for this one being a major rinderpest infection among the gaur population in India in 1968 that killed thousands of gaur and a surge in population thereafter Rinderpest also called cattle plague or steppe murrain was a fatal viral disease of cattle domestic buffalo and many other species of eventoed ungulates which was completely eradicated in India\n\nThis is corroborated by M Ashok Kumar The rinderpest infection had done severe damage to the gaur population in India he said It is documented in ERC Davidars book Cheetal Walk where he mentions that one could see gaur carcasses everywhere in Bandipur and Mudumalai The population however picked up soon after the virus was eradicated While there was only one individual per sq km soon after the infection in 2004 we noticed an eightfold increase  eight individuals per sq km he said\n\nGaurs are large bovines that have a wide home range with the individual male home range varying from 135 sq km to 142 sq km and overall individual female home range varying from 32 sq km to 169 sq km shows a study from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve on reintroduced gaurs\n\nThis shows that any forest area less than 50 sq km100 sq km is not viable for the gaur population said Kumar The Nilgiris district with an area of 2545 sq km holds an impressive forest area of 1719 sq km But this forest area is highly fragmented\n\nThe forests in the upper Nilgiris Kotagiri and Coonor areas are small fragmented and the higher elevation shola forests are not suitable for gaur reasons Kumar Changes in land use pattern such as the conversion of natural fallow land a grazing area for gaur for buildings reduces the nonforest habitat available for them\n\nThe district is also known for agriculture with 20192020 estimates showing 7346 sq kmland dedicated to various crops And these agricultural lands are more attractive to gaurs due to their easy accessibility and the presence of grass there Gaurs are grazers said Sukumar More than 80 of their food is grass But due to a surge of invasive plants like Lantana camara in the forests there is probably little grass for them to graze on\n\nKumar said the isolated grasslands which are grazing areas for gaur have been invaded by foreign species like wattle pine and Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius Invasive plants like Lantana camara and Cytisus scoparius give little scope for grass to grow\n\nThe depletion of grass left and invasion of lantana right in the gaurs natural habitats is considered to be one of the reasons the animal moved into agricultural areas for food Photos credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nAnother reason largely speculative though is climate change itself Global warming is changing the behaviour of many species and gaur could be one of them believe scientists\n\nKumar says the sudden proliferation of an invasive plant Senna spectabilis in these areas is a good indicator that climate change is altering landscapes and gaur could well be one of the species altering its behaviour\n\nMost importantly gaur has no natural predators Tigers are the only predators but studies have shown less than 30 of a tigers diet comprises gaur said Kumar They mostly eat cheetal and sambar deer The decline in poaching due to increased protection for wild species is another reason why gaur population is now strong said Sukumar\n\nLet them be\n\nDistrict collector Innocent Divya said despite the tolerance people have for these animals farmers complain of crop loss and demand the forests to be fenced It is not possible to restrain and restrict animals she said This is their land as much as it is ours As far as gaurs are concerned we just need to be mindful If we let them be they let us be\n\nRaman Sukumar said a much softer approach compared to other animals like leopards and elephants can be taken for gaurs since it is possible to live with them Accidents are an aberration otherwise it is possible to live with them he added We need to educate people to stay away from them respect their space\n\nDivya says the district will consider other measures like translocation if their population increases to a point it gets difficult to handle Experts feel translocation to larger adjacent protected areas is the best solution for herbivores like gaurs since they adapt effortlessly in newer environments unlike carnivores Rangeuse pattern and seasonal movements in adjacent areas will shed more light on how these animals are moving between patches said Kumar Identification of corridors can then be the next longterm solution Grassland restoration in gaurs natural habitat is another viable solution that could help prevent interactions with humans\n\nThis article first appeared on Mongabay",

                "Summary": "File image Patients watch a movie on a big screen at a makeshift COVID19 care center in New Delhi India on September 19 2020 Image AP PhotoAltaf Qadri\n\nDaily COVID19 cases being reported in India has stayed below the 40000mark in December In fact the sevenday average stood at around 29500 cases on December 14 the third time in the month when India reported less than 30000 new daily infections\n\nThis also meant that Indias COVID19 caseload stood at 352 lakh comprising just 35 percent of the overall tally The number of people who have recuperated from the infectious disease surged to 9388 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 9498 percent\n\nThese numbers are a far cry from the countrys record of 97894 new COVID19 cases reported in a single day on September 17\n\nLeading up to the festive season health authorities and the government had warned that social gatherings and not adhering safety protocols could lead to another wave of cases in India Medical experts had also cautioned that winter and air pollution in northern parts of the country could prove to be a dangerous combination and contribute to a spike in COVID19 cases In a short address to the nation on October 20 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also cautioned citizens against complacency in fighting the COVID19 outbreak during the festive season and amid reopening of economic activities\n\nFollow our LIVE blog for the latest updates of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nCOVID19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID19 infection but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely The good news is that SARSCoV2 virus has been fairly stable which increases the viability of a vaccine How many types of vaccines are there There are broadly four types of vaccine  one a vaccine based on the whole virus this could be either inactivated or an attenuated weakened virus vaccine two a nonreplicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARSCoV three nucleicacid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine and four protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARSCOV2 along with an adjuvant booster is given as a vaccine What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind Vaccine development is a long complex process Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children pregnant women and the elderly So rigorous tests are compulsory History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time View more Show\n\nThe number of COVID19 tests being carried out per day has also remained steady since September While a wave was witnessed in some regions of the country such as Delhi the nationwide numbers have continued to decline\n\nSo why have COVID19 cases dropped in India despite the festivals gatherings elections and the combination of air pollution and winter\n\nWhy are daily cases falling\n\nExperts suggest this could be mainly because a larger segment of the population than we currently estimate could have already been infected by COVID19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic\n\nIn fact the predictions of a computer model that we have developed actually tell us this As of Saturday December 12 this model has been suggesting that close to 55 percent of Indian population might have been infected Manindra Agarwal professor at IIT Kanpur told The Indian Express\n\nNone of the serosurveys are capturing such large numbers for disease prevalence And we dont know what could be the reason Agarwal added\n\nIt is being pointed out that the actual prevalence of COVID19 could have been 15 to 16 times higher than the confirmed cases when the last nationwide serological survey was conducted If India has reported close to 1 crore confirmed cases now the actual disease prevalence could be 1516 crore\n\nBut it is possible that the outbreak has moved faster than we have been able to record Because of that it could be that instead of 150 to 160 million 1516 crore people 400 or 500 million 4050 crore have been infected Shahid Jameel a virologist and director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at the Ashoka University told the newspaper\n\nHowever the other possibility being suggested is that the novel coronavirus may have lost some of its severity because of increased exposure However there is currently no evidence to prove that",

                "Summary": "Note This story was first published on March 28 2017 and was republished on December 15 2020\n\nHalf a planet away from the immediacy of politics that dominates our headlines theres a crisis unfolding that can dog us for centuries In West Antarctica a huge ice shelf called Larsen C has developed a rift 175 kilometres long and halfakilometre wide A chunk of the shelf is poised to break off soon When that happens the chunk will be an iceberg over 5000 sq km across and 350m high  more than four times the height of Delhis Qutub Minar and over an area oneandahalf times the size of Goa And we need to pay more attention because it could potentially gravely impact Indias people in the near and long term\n\nIce shelves are extensions of ice sheets are fed by their glaciers and jut hundreds of kilometres out to sea Sprawled over 48600 sq km Larsen C is a little larger than Haryana It is Antarcticas fourthlargest ice shelf and an extension of the gigantic West Antarctic Ice Sheet WAIS The rift in Larsen C has been growing in recent weeks by several kilometres at a time\n\nThe mammoth icebergtobe  lets call it Goa Plus  is currently attached to Larsen C by 20 kilometres of ice It could break off entirely anytime in the next few months weakening the ice shelf further This happened to its nowextinct cousin Larsen B In 1995 a large chunk of Larsen B broke off and B itself disintegrated spectacularly over a 35day period in 2002\n\nPeerreviewed research has yet to conclusively demonstrate that global warming is responsible for the accelerating rift in Larsen C although background warming conditions have made that likely Temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula where Larsen C is located have been rising at four to six times the global average according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Fifth Assessment Report 5AR Global warming also traps warmer subsurface ocean waters because of which climate change has caused a thinning of the Larsen C ice shelf the team studying it said last month\n\nBut Larsen Cs disintegration will not occur next week In a mental landscape increasingly dominated by mobile phones tweets and the ephemeral nature of Breaking News whats happening to Larsen C illustrates a key trait about global warming that will take some effort to get our heads around Many of its slower effects unfold over long periods After the chunk broke off Larsen B in 1995 it kept getting smaller eventually disintegrating only seven years later\n\nAdrian Luckman a professor of glaciology at the Swansea University Wales and project leader of the group studying Larsen C wrote this author an email recently If the shelf continues to erode slowly after this calving event  as was the case with Larsen B  then it will be years until the remaining shelf is eroded far enough for a complete destabilisation\n\nAccelerating sea level rise\n\nThe vast WAIS Klaus Doddss The Antarctic informs us is marinebased its base is below sea level Its edges transform into floating ice shelves So Larsen Cs collapse will not by itself contribute to sea level rise as it is already floating in water But the glaciers that feed into Larsen C can because when an ice shelf gives way these glaciers start to flow much faster into the sea\n\nThe collapse of Larsen B which is unprecedented in the last 10000 years has resulted in a speeding up of the tributary glaciers by 300 to 800 says the 5AR Thats not good news Larsen C is five times as large as Larsen B was The glaciers it holds back contain vastly more ice and as has been reported could contribute a sealevel rise of 10 cm\n\nAnd all this is part of an accelerating rise that may have already begun Per the IPCC the average rate of ice loss from Antarctica has increased from 30 billion tonnes a year over 19922001 to 147 billion tonnes a year over 20022011 Twentieth century sea level rise was linear increasing in fixed steps because its chief sources were ocean expansion due to warmer waters and glacial melting It will happen at an exponentially growing rate this century because the main source will be the melting of and faster ice flows from the gigantic ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica\n\nIn a paper published last March the renowned climate scientist James Hansen and others foresee a nonlinearly growing sea level rise reaching several metres over a timescale of 50150 years\n\nImplications for India\n\nTen centimetres of average sea level rise from the collapse of Larsen C may not seem like much until we put that figure in perspective Its a little over half of all the sea level rise the world has already experienced since 1901 This should deeply concern us Sea level rise in the Sunderbans is significantly higher than the global average thanks to its topography and that its land is subsiding When a team this author was part of visited some islands in the Sunderbans a couple years ago we spoke to numerous people whose earliest homes had since been swallowed under water It was easy to meet people who had moved three or four times due to advancing erosion There were also fragmented families living around agricultural lands and water sources that had turned saline and farmers being forced to migrate in the thousands\n\nErosion and sea ingress are also happening on the coasts of Gujarat Tamil Nadu and elsewhere But an accelerating sea level rise will means that what is happening in Sunderbans today will occur all along Indias 7500km coastline tomorrow  with the potential to devastate coastal communities The lives of millions of people will surely get affected by events that seem very distant\n\nLarsen B disintegrated in 2002 A 570sqkm chunk of the Wilkins ice shelf broke off in 2008 The 5000sqkm Goa Plus will break off Larsen C in 2017 These are early warning signs to which we should pay heed These dramatic events provide much food for thought They are for all practical purposes irreversible and no one expects Larsen B to reform in the foreseeable future and hold its glaciers in check once again\n\nWe also need to internalise the longterm nature of the changes that are being wrought such as ice sheet destabilisation in Antarctica and elsewhere Individually and collectively humans have become used to providing for our old age and thinking about the wellbeing of our next generation  but not beyond Now we need to reconsider how we think about global warming and its impact which will continue to haunt many generations in India and around the world for centuries to come\n\nNagraj Adves booklet Global Warming in the Indian Context has been translated into Hindi Kannada and Tamil He works and writes on issues related to global warming",
