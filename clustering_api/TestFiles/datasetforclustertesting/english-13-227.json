		"Summary" : " Provided by The Indian Express\n\nA new flashpoint has emerged in the Centres tussle with West Bengal with the Home Ministry calling to New Delhi three IPS officers who were responsible for providing security to BJP national president J P Nadda  and the state refusing\n\nCars in Naddas motorcade were stoned by alleged Trinamool Congress workers on the outskirts of Kolkata on Thursday On Friday the state government had declined to comply with a Home Ministry summons to the chief secretary and director general of police to present themselves in Delhi on Monday for a meeting on law and order in West Bengal\n\nSources said that in a communication sent to the chief secretary and DGP on Friday the Home Ministry directed IG South Bengal Range Rajiv Mishra DIG Presidency Range Praveen Tripathi and SP North 24Parganas Bholanath Pandey to report for deputation with the Government of India\n\nAlso Read Bengal governor flays Mamata over Nadda convoy attack summons chief secy DGP\n\nThe letter sources said was written after West Bengal Chief Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla asking to be excused from the proposed meeting on law and order since the state government was already addressing the issue with utmost seriousness\n\nIn response to the Centres letter about the three IPS officers West Bengal is learnt to have written back saying it would not be able to spare the officers  and that they would not be sent to Delhi\n\nWe already have low numbers of IPS officers in the state So we wrote that it will not be possible to adhere to their request and release the officers a senior officer at the West Bengal home department said\n\nSenior Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee accused the Centre of being vindictive Last evening the MHA wrote a letter to the state government asking that the three IPS officers would have to be attached to the Centre The vindictiveness of MHA and the central government is clear Law and order is a state subject BJP never took permission for the rally they conducted that day in the name of a convoy I have already written to MHA about this Banerjee said\n\nTMC Lok Sabha MP Prof Sougata Ray said The Centre may ask for names for central deputation But it is for the state to decide whether or not to allow the IPS or IAS officers for central deputation There is no other option This happens when there is a vacancy\n\nAlso Read Deputation row Final word with Centre but history shows forcing will on state not easy\n\nWhile under normal circumstances IPS officers are sent on deputation to the Centre with the states consent the Centre does have the power to call any IPS officer to the Centre\n\nUnder Rule 6 of the IPS Cadre Rules 1954 in case of disagreement between Centre and state over an officers deputation with the Government of India the will of the Centre prevails\n\nA cadre officer may with the concurrence of the State Government and the Central Government be deputed for service under the Central Government or another State Government or under a company Provided that in case of any disagreement the matter shall be decided by the Central Government and the State Government shall give effect to the decision of the Central Government\n\nExplained\n\nFederal principle at stake court may be in play\n\nTechnically the Centre has the right to call an officer on deputation and in case of a disagreement its decision prevails However given the federal structure the Centre does not usually insist This matter could well end up in court\n\nHowever keeping in mind the federal structure of the country the Centre rarely uses this order Normally the Centre writes to states every year asking for a list of officers for central deputation Based on the willingness of officers not binding on the state the state governments send an Offer List for central deputation The GoI then decides which officer in the offer list will be posted where This year the Centre wrote to the states on December 7 for the offer list for 2021\n\nThere have been instances of tussles between state governments and the Centre over the deputation of officers in the recent past\n\nTamil Nadu and the Centre had a few years ago sparred over the deputation of state cadre officer Archana Ramasundaram In 2014 the UPA government had called Ramasundaram to the Centre where she was expected to join the CBI as ADG When the state government did not relieve her for three months she reported to the Centre on her own The state government suspended her for going to the Centre without being relieved\n\nThe matter went to the Supreme Court and Ramasundaram retained her central deputation but lost the opportunity to serve in the CBI She was finally appointed Director General of Sashastra Seema Bal becoming the first woman to head a paramilitary force\n\nTop News Right Now\n\nClick here for more\n\nGujarat cadre IPS officer Kuldeep Sharma had similarly fought his way to the Centre in 2012\n\nIn these cases however the officers were willing to serve at the Centre and had figured in the offer list which is not the case in West Bengal now\n\nSources said the matter could reach the courts While the Centre has the right to call officers to GoI even without the states consent the state can argue in court that the Centres decision is mala fide or informed by bias against the state a senior IPS officer said"

		"Title" : "Why the demand for the release of intellectuals?",
		"PublishDate" : "2020-12-13 04:04:49.000000",
		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "The intellectuals whose release we are demanding are those who have stood firm against the oppressive and communal attacks waged by the Modi government on Indian society They have made huge sacrifices and are now braving a life in prison but they have never shied away from their duty to speak truth to power and communicate this truth to the people\n\nWith their pen art and speech they have exposed the communal and pro corporate agendas of the BJP government They have raised their voice in support of the adivasis whose rights have been violated by the government just so as to facilitate the greed of the corporate and business class\n\nActivists like Stan Swamy have spent their lives in the forests of Jharkhand Intellectuals like Sudha Bhardwaj have dedicated all their knowledge and educational qualification for the upliftment of poor workers They have given up every kind of comfort and luxury and made the service of workers their mission\n\nTheir only fault is that they have stood firm against the procorporate policies of antipeople governments They have played a critical role in creating awareness organizing and mobilizing those who are being oppressed  the people of Kashmir women Dalits adivasis and all others who are oppressed and marginalized in our country\n\nCompanies like Vedanta could not deter their resolve with all their dollars And this is why they have become targets of false allegations Sometimes they are labelled urban naxals sometimes antinational and sometimes they have been called the tukdetukde gang We must remember that such allegations have been levelled against not only these intellectuals and activists but also so many innocent young men and women among all these oppressed and marginalised sections This includes people whose families were first targeted during communal violence in Delhi and later they themselves were accused of that very violence and thrown in jails under draconian laws\n\nAs such is it not our duty that we speak up for and embolden the voice of these warriors of truth We have not raised our voice for them for the first time We have been voicing our concerns ever since emergencylike provisions were being created during the Covid19 pandemic lockdown The demand for the release of the intellectuals and activists has been put forth right from the beginning of our current struggle\n\nTheir photographs have been put up across sites of dharnas and protests in Punjab The demand is also included in the charter of demands that we put in front of the Central government Not only has been included in our organisations list of demands it has also been raised by the platform of 30 kisan organizations The entire democratic movement in Punjab has been raising the demand for their release ever since they have been targeted by the government By resisting and opposing the poisonous communal propaganda of the Modi government in the past 6 years Punjab has been a beacon of hope for the entire country\n\nFor people of Punjab targeting these intellectuals and activists is akin to targeting prominent journalists like Charanjit Bhullar and Davinderpal and activists like Prof Jagmohan Singh nephew of Shaheed Bhagat Singh in order to silence people speaking for human rights The state wants to ensure that nobody takes up cases of human rights activists in the courts It would be like putting theatre activists performing in villages to make people aware of their rights in jail It would be like putting late theatre artist Gursharan Singh in jail for his acts of resistance against state repression Socially engaged intellectuals have informed the farmers about the reality of farm laws They have exposed the true character of the laws touted as welfare measures These people have been targeted by the ruling class and hence are implicated in false cases Raising out voice for these propeople activists mean raising our voice for the people It also means enabling them to continue with the important work of exposing antipeople policies of the state Mobilising support for these activists means strengthening these voices and being on the side of justice\n\nViolation of human rights in rampant in our society We have consistently raised our voice against such violations We unconditionally stand for human rights of workers from all the castes religions races regions and languages We do not speak for any specific section of the society We support all ideological struggles against communal politics We are strongly against those who violate the laws of the land which ensure freedom of speech and expression to everyone\n\nThe people put in jails became target of the state as they exercised their right to free speech On the occasion of International Human Rights Day it is important that we raise our voice in their support We have fulfilled our duty by raising our voice in their favour and we will keep on doing so It will be wrong to associate this demand of ours with any religion caste colour or region BJP has resorted to the policy of divide and rule which people need to be aware of They dub anyone who raises the voice for rights of people as a traitor It is their tested formula to defame peoples voices as seditious or insinuate that they are coloured by a specific religion or ideology They dub dissenting voices as Naxalites or Pakistan sponsored terrorists We should be conscious about the troll armies managed by their partys IT cell\n\nTheir advice to us that we remain confined to farmers issues is flawed The demand for the release of intellectuals is integral to peoples struggles They have been arrested to erode intellectual support of peoples struggles The state wants people to remain confined to their narrow identities and narrow interests so that no one resists people being subjected to repression and torture The state finds it easy to control people when they are divided It is important to build solidarities around people who are the target of sectarian and communal state policies We are of the opinion that pursing narrow interests and keeping aloof from the wider democraticminded community will weaken our struggle rather than strengthening it Let us unite our struggle with the voices of all people victimised by the state\n\nState Committee BKU EktaUgrahan\n\nSIGN UP FOR COUNTERCURRENTS DAILY

		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "During the special meeting of the National Green Tribunal NGT nominated Permanent Committee to discuss the stray dogs menace at IITMadras IITM campus Padma Shri Dr Ashok Jhunjhunwala a professor at the institute representing the concerns of the professors staying inside the campus said that stray dogs were adversely affecting the reputation of the institute both nationally and globally\n\nIn the meeting held on December 3 Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala mentioned that visiting faculty and students from foreign countries had expressed serious concerns over the dog menace adversely affecting the reputation of the institute which is ranked number 1 in the country thereby indirectly affection the reputation of the nation too\n\nIIT Madras has been granted the position of Institute of Eminence and it is expected that more number of foreign faculty and students will visit and stay on campus in the coming years If this dog menace continues it will give us negative feedback among the foreign faculty and students It will severely affect our institute reputation among world class institutions Prof Jhunjhunwala said in the meeting He also urged the committee and the NGT to consider these aspects while taking any decision regarding the stray dog menace in the campus\n\nProf Jhunjhunwala said that he himself was intimidated by packs of ferocious stray dogs many times inside the campus and that most of the time he could not step out of the car for fear of getting chased and bitten\n\nHe said that as a resident who had lived in the campus for 40 years the stray dog menace has gotten severe in the past 23 years mainly due to the sudden increase in the number of stray dogs that have been let loose in the campus\n\nRecently the Chennai Wildlife Warden CH Padma who is also part of the committee constituted by the NGT has increased the number of feeding centres inside the campus for stray dogs to from 5 14 after pressure from doglover groups in the campus She had also permitted feeding of homecooked food\n\nProf Jhunjhunwala mentioned that a survey conducted among 400 faculty members living in the campus on the opinion of increasing feeding locations resulted in 98 of them vehemently being against the move He said that residents were furious about the increase in feeding centres adding that neither people travelling in two wheelers could travel in peace nor children could play outside as rabid dogs chase them\n\nHe also highlighted the endless attacks by the feral dogs on the deers and blackbucks which has drastically reduced their population\n\nDr Jhunjhunwala also submitted a number of recommendations asking the number of freeranging dogs to be kept at a number that does not disrupt the academic life in the campus including sterilization electronically tagging the dogs caging the feral dog pack leaders and restricting the feeding points to 34 locations However any attempt to remove the stray dogs and bring in regulations to protect the endangered species is being obstructed by doglover groups in the campus and animal activists who try to engage NGOs run by them or their known circles to take care of these rabid stray dogs The NGO that has been engaged in IITMadras to take care of these dogs is Jeeva Karunya Animal Welfare Trust run by Shoba Chellathurai and Joe Prakash Jacob\n\nThere have been allegations that the incumbent Registrar of the institution Dr Jane Prasad has been favouring Christians primarily those from the Nagercoil district in appointments She is said to have brought Jeeva Karunya Animal Welfare Trust of Nagercoil for feeding sterilization and microchipping of the stray dogs\n\nOn the other hand selfproclaimed animal activist Antony Clement Rubin has challenged Dr Jhunjhunwalas appeal to the NGT nominated Permanent Committee He has been advocating the institute to spend money out of its coffers to set up dog parks dog clinicsdog feeding spots He has presented with an action plan on how to save deers from stray dogs It is to be noted that Anthony Clement Rubin an antiJallikattu campaigner has been going after several temple elephants in Tamil Nadu and trying to oust them from the temples to be sent to elephant camps run by the government\n\nAntony Clement Rubin who works for Chinny Krishna and Menka Gandhi have challenged this in NGT They are advocating the Institute to spend money and take care of the dogs they have devised a plan with the new Evangelical gang of contracted care takers and wasting tax pictwittercomGJe0VQdsUc  Indu Makkal Katchi  இந்த மக்கள் கட்ச  Off  Indumakalktchi December 11 2020\n\nIndu Makkal Katchi IMK the only political party in Tamil Nadu which has been voicing out against the rampant stray dog menace at IITM has been calling for protecting the deers blackbuck and native wildlife species in the campus\n\nSpeaking to The Commune Mr Sathyanarayanan spokesperson of the IMK said even a child knows that the only way to save wildlife in the campus is to remove stray dogs that have invaded the reserved forest area and not provide them shelters\n\nS Muralidharan a Chennai based animal activist told The Commune that it is outrageous that a reserve forest is being used as a feeding and breeding ground for stray dogs We all love dogs and there are a plenty of them on the streets But to bring them into a reserve forest feed them mindlessly which later goes on to kill native wildlife in the forest is just ridiculous Mr Muralidharan said"

		"PublishDate" : "2020-12-13 13:56:54.000000",
		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : " Provided by News18 Bidens Challenge Building Cabinet That Meets All His Goals\n\nWASHINGTON Shortly after Presidentelect Joe Bidens victory last month Cabinet hopeful Marcia Fudge pointedly noted that Black people are often typecast into positions such as housing secretary On Friday Biden announced Fudge a prominent Black congresswoman from Ohio was his nominee for that very role She was introduced alongside Bidens pick for the job she initially sought head of the Agriculture Department That went instead to Tom Vilsack a 70yearold white man who already spent eight years in the position during the Obama administration Those nominations highlight the competing priorities Biden is facing as he fills out the top ranks of his administration Hes pledged to nominate the most diverse Cabinet in history and restore experience at beleaguered federal agencies Hes seeking to reward loyalists who have stood with him throughout his lengthy career and give opportunities to new voices in the Democratic Party Each of his nominees has to win confirmation in a narrowly divided Senate that could be controlled by Republicans depending on who wins two runoff races in Georgia next month The GOP has barely acknowledged Bidens victory so the cooperation of its senators in the confirmation process is far from certain Theres a lot of pressure and part of the reason you saw such big turnout is that people are eager for change from the Trump years said Democratic strategist Karen Finney That creates a lot of high expectations The challenge wont get easier Biden is facing a decision on attorney general that will come under intense scrutiny from Black leaders who want someone with a background in civil rights advocacy and Republicans who are demanding political independence as Bidens son Hunter faces a federal investigation into his finances Some of those tensions emerged last week during a meeting between Biden and civil rights leaders who pressed the incoming president to diversify his Cabinet and warned about the Vilsack pick in particular Vilsack has been criticized for the firing of department official Shirley Sherrod who is Black during his last stint at the USDA a move he later apologized for NAACP President Derrick Johnson warned Biden that the Vilsack selection could hurt Black turnout in the critical Georgia contests Vilsack could have a disastrous effect on voters in the state of Georgia NAACP President Derrick Johnson told Biden during the meeting which was private Audio was leaked to The Intercept which released excerpts Biden bristled at such concern saying Lets get something straight you shouldnt be upset What Ive done so far is more than what anyone else has done this far he added I mean what I say The presidentelect has several more Cabinet posts to fill and has made history with some of his early selections He nominated retired Army Gen Lloyd Austin to be the first Black person to lead the Pentagon while picking California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be the first Latino to lead the Health and Human Services Department His nominee for US trade envoy Katherine Tai was born in Connecticut to Taiwanese parents But those choices were announced after African Americans Latinos and Asian Americans in Congress voiced concerns that their perspectives may not be fully represented in the new administration Some nominees will face other hurdles most notably Austin who needs a waiver to fill the civilian role leading the Pentagon Thats a step some Democrats have historically opposed Biden could further diversify his Cabinet by picking Rep Deb Haaland of New Mexico as the first Native American interior secretary giving her authority over a powerful agency that oversees the nations tribes But doing so would further erode the razor thin Democratic majority in the House something Biden can ill afford considering the partys tenuous standing in the Senate Theres particular frustration that until Tais nomination there was no one of Asian descent in a Cabinetlevel secretary position California Rep Judy Chu the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus said she suggested senior roles for Asian Americans during the campaign and transition only for action to come at the last minute We tried to work collaboratively during the campaign Chu said Thats why we are worried One prominent feature of Bidens picks so far deep ties to the Obama administration That includes exWhite House chief of staff Denis McDonough as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs and former UN ambassador and national security adviser Susan Rice as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council Bidens team has said long government experience is paramount at a time when the country is facing a historic pandemic and economic uncertainty But other Democrats are urging him to blend those familiar faces with newer voices We have some people whove been in the Cabinet before  theres a role for those people especially in a crisis like this they have the knowledge  but its important to be adding voices and lifting up the next generation of leaders said Rep Katie Porter DCalif Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez DNY also voiced concern that there was no cohesive vision emerging from Bidens slate of advisers We can wrestle about whether they are bold enough or ambitious enough especially given the uncertainty and what kind of Senate were going to have OcasioCortez said But aside from that I think one of the things Im looking for when I see all of these picks together is What is the agenda What is the overall vision going to be After a largely centrist primary bid won him the Democratic presidential nomination Biden sought to incorporate more progressive priorities into his general election campaign promising to invest billions in new green jobs and make major improvements to infrastructure to battle climate change But some progressive leaders including Sens Elizabeth Warren DMass and Bernie Sanders IVt seem unlikely to land in the Cabinet given the transition teams concerns about poaching from Democrats ranks in the Senate Thats left some activists worried that the administration wont live up to its campaign promises to the partys left flank I think there are some red flags or in this case some discouraging blue flags said Norman Solomon national director of the progressive activist group RootsAction Solomon said progressive groups are prepared to organize to try and block the nomination of Bidens pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget IndianAmerican Neera Tanden because of her past antagonism toward Sanders They also oppose many of Bidens picks from the Democratic establishment including incoming senior adviser Cedric Richmond a Louisiana congressman with close ties to oil and gas companies active in his energyrich district Brent Colburn a former Obama administration official who served in several agencies encouraged Democrats to consider the bigger picture as they judge Bidens Cabinet What will ultimately impact the success of the Biden presidency is his ability to build a team that is qualified tested and that he is comfortable taking advice and counsel from Colburn said You have to assess these picks in context of the long game ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta

		"Summary" : "Authors Note Ok so before we get into todays post we have two requests If you like the post and learn something new from it do click on the heart icon Second do share the post with your colleagues friends and family to help us grow \n\nIn India close to 76 of the people in workforce are working without any employment contract And approximately half of these are daily wage earners earning anywhere between 150 INR 2  to 1000 INR 135  per day Hence unlike the more fortunate ones they buy products of daily use food items toiletries etc very frequently either daily or after every 23 days And to reach to this underserved customer base FMCG companies introduced sachets A daily wage earner cannot afford to spend 300 INR 4  on a bottle of shampoo but can buy a 2 INR 25 cents sachet which would last him for 2 days And thats why almost every FMCG product in India toothpaste shampoos detergent hair oil and even coffee has a SKU which is sold in a sachet\n\nBut close to 40 years back most of these FMCG products were sold in large packets and bottles Hence they were only limited to those who were well off There was no concept of sachets back then But a small entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu introduced the concept of sachets to the entire country forcing even the large MNCs to follow suit In the process he ended up building a 500 crores INR shampoo brand called Chik And today almost 70 of the shampoo sales in India happen in sachets\n\nChik Shampoo\n\nIn todays Simplanation we would go through the growth story of Chik its effective marketing and sales strategy\n\nThe Beginning of Chik\n\nIn 1978 Chinnikrishnan an agriculturist also ran a small pharmaceutical business in Cuddalore Tamil Nadu In an attempt to innovate packaging of products he created the concept of sachets First he packed talcum powder into small sachets and started selling them to nearby shops After sometime he also thought that liquid could also be packed in sachets And thats when he started selling shampoos in sachets as well His vision was to make affordable products which could be used by coolies rickshaw pullers and other daily wage earners But he couldnt market these products well He passed away in 1982\n\nThe small business was overtaken by his sons who started a small regional company called Velvette shampoo which sold its products in small parts of Tamil Nadu The youngest brother CK Ranganathan decided to part ways with the brothers in 1983 and started his own cosmetics business with savings of 15000 Rs He started manufacturing shampoo sachets in a small shed and hired two chemistry graduates to work on formulations He named the shampoo Chik priced at 075 INR which was affordable for even the poor daily wage earners His primary target was the south indian rural market In its first month Chik sold 20k sachets\n\nCK Ranganathan The founder of Chik shampoo source Google Images\n\nIn its second year of operations Chik became profitable and started gaining good traction After becoming a common name in the rural markets of TN the company shifted base to Chennai in 1989 and named itself Beauty cosmetics Pvt Ltd By then few other players like HUL and Godrej had also entered this segment but Chik was still much ahead of them in the sachet segment Unlike his family business which was slow to grow CK Ranganathan deployed multiple marketing and sales tactics which helped Chik become a famous brand in the state of Tamil Nadu\n\nMarketing and Sales strategy\n\nThe success of Chic shampoo lies solely in understanding the needs and behavior of their customers well And all their marketing strategies reflect a great empathy for their consumers\n\nFirstly to attract and educate rural customers a lot of whom had never used a shampoo in their life Chik sales staff started running free movie shows in the villages of southern states of India With limited access to any kind of entertainment these free shows drew huge crowds Between the movies they played ads and showed live demonstration of using a Chik shampoo They also gave free sachets to audience to try This helped them gain a great brand awareness to the extent that the name became synonymous with the shampoo category\n\nWith bigger FMCG players entering around 1988 Chik adopted an innovative scheme where a customer could return 5 sachets of any shampoo to a retailer and get a Chik Sachet free The scheme was later altered where they started giving a free shampoo in exchange of sachets of only Chik Shampoo The price sensitive customers started buying only Chik Shampoo Though the scheme was discontinued after 10 months the habit of the customers continued This scheme worked wonders for the company with sales almost doubling to 10 lacs sachets per month in just an years time The turnover crossed 1 crore INR in 1989\n\nIn 1990 the company launched two variants with floral fragrances rose and jasmine In the southern part of the country women typically decorate their hair with jasmine flowers This move again worked very well for Chic and they tripled their sales to 30 lac sachets per month by 1991 All these efforts bore fruit and Chic became the number one shampoo brand in South India\n\nExpanding to other parts of the country was a tougher challenge given that Chik was famous only in the southern part of the country So it wanted that the distributors push their products more to the wholesalers and retailers and the retailers display Chik in more prominent parts of the store and ask the customers to buy this new product Hence they started offering the distributors and retailers 12 extra margins compared to the competition The competition brands didnt want to give up on their margins and hence decided to stick to the older structure This helped Chic grow some good traction in other parts of the country as well By 1992 the annual revenue of the company had reached 12 crores INR\n\nIn 1998 the companys name was changed to Cavin Kare Cavin means beauty in Tamil from Beauty Cosmetics In 1998 the company had a market share of around 6 The shampoo sachets from most of the companies used to cost between 1 and 2 INR Basis the consumer research they found that still a good segment of customers were not buying shampoos because they found the price point costly So they launched a 050 INR shampoo in 1998 which became a blockbuster hit By 2003 Chik had become the second largest national brand in India with 22 market share just a little below HULs Clinic Plus The revenues had reached close to 200 crores INR by 2003\n\nPositioning Handicap\n\nChik was always known for being a low cost shampoo With more demand for premium shampoos like Sunsilk Dove etc Chik also tried to upgrade its positioning by launching Chik Satin as a premium product But given the associated brand image it was very difficult to extend the same into premium shampoos as well Hence the new product was a failure With this handicap of positioning Chiks growth plateaued and other brands started growing through premiumization One more trend that Chik couldnt catchup on was the introduction of anti dandruff shampoos which went on to become 25 of the total market size by 2011 Chik did not introduce any anti dandruff shampoo Chiks market share had gone down from 22 in 2003 to a mere 5 in 2011\n\nBut even today Chik is a famous brand in the rural parts of the country which made sachets so popular that almost every FMCG product has a sachet version today Today it clocks close to 500 crores INR in revenues every year  is the biggest brand of the 2000 crores INR Cavin Kare group Apart from the shampoo company launched some more interesting products like Spintz perfume sold in 10 INR bottle and Fairever cream with Kesar saffron which also became big hits Today the group has over 100 products in FB and personal care space Chik did manage to introduce sachets on a large scale making daily use products affordable for millions But at the same time these sachets have been one of the major causes for pollution of rivers and landfills And thats something that both the company and the society should have been thoughtful about\n\nOk before I finish I got to know one more interesting point that I never really noticed The per unit price per ml price in a shampoo sachet is always cheaper than the per unit price in a shampoo bottle And the same hold true for other products as well Ever thought why is that the case  Do share your thoughts in the comments \n\nREFERENCES"

		"Summary" : "In November alone the Allahabad High Court issued orders providing relief to couples in more than 125 cases web journal livelawin reported on Dec1 They were involved in intercaste and interfaith marriages But UPs CM his colleagues in power and UP police have no fear indeedthey uphold rabid hindutva\n\nPM Narendra Modi quoted Subramanya Bharathi Tamilnadus great poet in his address at International Bharati Festival 2020 11 December 2020 His collected works have been published in 16 volumes in 39 years he wrote so much in so diverse forms said Modi Bharati also had a close link with Varanasi his constituency Modis lofty words need to be contextualized\n\nTamilians must be happy as Modi quotes Bharati He is found in recent years quoting often Tamil lines even from Tirukkural But they must be wary too Now Modi and BJP want to bring Tamilnadu closer  as elections there are nearing due in May next \n\n Mahakavi Bharathiyars definition of progress had a central role for women  One of the most important vision was that of independent and empowered women Bharatiyaar wrote that women should walk with their head held high while looking people in the eye said Modi Today over 15 crore women entrepreneurs are funded by schemes like MUDRA Yojana They are walking with their head held high looking us in the eye and telling us how they are becoming selfreliant\n\nToday women are becoming part of our armed forces with permanent commissioning They are walking with their head held high and looking us in the eye and filling us with confidence that the country is in safe hands Modi said of Modi and Shah \n\nEnterprise and boldness of women which Modi praised did not perhaps should not include personal lives nor choice in marriage And Yogi Adityanath appears to emulate Modis quote Fear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me He led and at least 8 states all BJP ruled are engaged in legislating against love jihad He issued an ordinance for the purpose and within days action began\n\nIn UP an interfaith couple engaged for marriage were recently picked up in Lucknow on December 2 at the marriage site by police based on the new law soon after the law was made They were midway through a preparations of a hindu marriage It was by consent mutual as well as by parents They were held and stopped upon a complaint made by Hindu Yuva Vahini not anyone related to the couple as required by even by the lawless UP law\n\nTrouble was the Hinduborn Lucknow bride aged 22 from UP looked into the eyes of a muslim man aged 24 She believed in UPs Allahabad High Court orders which very recently said the state should not interfere in such matters of marital choiceBut Rule of Law as practised nowadays led the couple into police station They must get prior approval of the district Magistrate to get into such marriage which may involve religious conversion they were officially told even as they insisted it was a union by mutual consent\n\nThe above was not an isolated incident Next day in Aligarh court premises another couple who came to register their marriage were stopped Times of India Dec 4 reported The Muslim young man aged 21 was thrashed and taken to an Aligarh police station The girl was whisked away by women police even as she shouted she aged 21 was not a minor and they were marrying by mutual consent\n\nIn November alone the Allahabad High Court issued orders providing relief to couples in more than 125 cases web journal livelawin reported on Dec1 They were involved in intercaste and interfaith marriages\n\nFear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me believes Yogi Adityanath CM of UP emulating Modi He does not fear Courts too Nor do UP police fear courts even High Court\n\nFormer IPS officer NC Asthana had said   The UP law is teeming with blunders that strongly indicate the real intent of the law is to harass people so much that conversion per se is discouraged Incidentally this Lucknow marriage did not involve conversion The Muslim groom was following Hindu rituals of marriage\n\nMembers of several Hindu outfits vandalized Quila police station in Bareilly town UP IANS reported Oct 21 as the police failed to trace a girl who allegedly eloped with a boy She claimed she was a major married by mutual consent there was no complaint of coercion and asked police not to harass the family of the boy of a different community DIG and ADG of police rushed with additional forces and saved the situation There was no love jihad issue the ADG said The Hindutva vigilants may not know Modis quote but had no fear emboldened by the Yogi\n\nSubramanian swamy of the Sangh parivar and a BJP leader pointed out Congress govt of Himachal in 2010 passed a similar law and it was upheld by HP High Court Last year when Himachal passed a more draconian Bill it was unanimously passed Congress too cooperated pointed out Swaminathan Aiyar Times of India Dec 6 2020 who desired the Court must strike down all such laws Modi and Rahul Gandhi speak lofty things while their state units shift the polity to the Right Keralas congress unit did a similar thing in relation to Sabarimalas restrictions on women\n\nWith Modi and Amit Shah at the helm aided by Tamil some leaders and film stars a woman included Tamil nadu is being drawn nearer Fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me believes PMKs Dr Ramdas who has launched his own version of love jihad he openly campaigns against vanniyar community girls marriages with dalit men PMK despite such chauvinism in action had no trouble in allying with Periyarist self respect parties DMK and AIADMK and throughout them with both UPA and NDA\n\nI begin by paying tributes to the great Bharathiyar on his Jayanti Bharathiyar believed in a healthy mix between the ancient and the modernHe considered Tamil Language and motherland India as his two eyes He sang the greatness of the Vedas and Upanishads our culture tradition and our glorious past But at the same time he also warned us that simply living in the past glory is not enough\n\nYes healthy mix for Modis India between the ancient and the modern means combining Chanakya and Machiavelli sedition and UAPA laws\n\nMahakavi Bharatiyaar understood that any society which is divided will not be able to succeed At the same time he wrote about the emptiness of political freedom which does not address the social inequities and does not address social ills We need to develop a scientific temper a spirit of enquiry and march towards progress\n\nany society which is divided will not be able to succeed But it is found that BJP will succeed with every kind of division between not only religious communities and castes  but also between sunnis and shias and between subcastes Modis speech extracts are based on PMOPIB Text \n\nOnly the day before December 10 2020 scientific temper a spirit of enquiry was displayed in another function addressed by Modi and that spirit can be seen in the photo below\n\nSpeaking at the foundationlaying ceremony of new Parliament building the Prime Minister said that inauguration of the construction work of the new Parliament House of India is one of the most important stages of our democratic tradition What is new of this We shall see\n\nAmidst Sanskrit chants by priests from the Sringeri Mutt in Karnataka PM Modi performed rituals around a holy pyre Priests from other religious faiths also offered prayers and blessing as the foundation stone was layer  This mutt was actively engaged for years in BJPs Ayodhya projectDD photo\n\nThe new parliament building is the key piece of the Rs 20000crore Central Vista project which aims to build and refurbish the government buildings on part of the 3 km Rajpath that stretches from the presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan to the iconic war memorial India Gate\n\nThe construction cannot begin for now with the Supreme Court hearing many many petitions challenging the project But the Court gave a green signal for the function even before the petitions are disposed of After all it involved the Prime Minister\n\nAnd the top Court nowadays is known not to create any problems for the establishment Like in Indira Gandhis days it is a committed judiciary Cases are filed heard and disposed of It is inevitable These are vagaries of Indian democracy and rule of Law It heard the Rafael case had initially expressed some doubts but finally fell in line The Union Govt submitted that there was a typo or grammar mistake in the affidavit it filed The court listened and heeded\n\nIt is an impressive project and I wish it all success I am privileged to be invited to the foundation stone laying ceremony said Ratan Tata Chairman Tata Trusts Tata Projects Ltd has been given contract for the construction project of the new Parliament building He was one of the 200 dignitaries invited to the function Why only Ambani and Adani others too have a share in the cake they seem to convey \n\nIf the old Parliament House gave direction to postindependence India the new building would become a witness to the creation of Atmanirbhar Bharat If work is done to fulfill the needs of the country in the old Parliament House then the aspirations of 21st century India will be fulfilled in the new building Modi said at the foundationlaying ceremony of new Parliament building The proposed fourstoried building would sprawl over an area of 64500 sq meters and cost an estimated Rs 971 crore It is a part of the Central Vista project\n\nAtmanirbhar Bharat is built by more and more of FDI including 100 in defence sector more and more of subservience to USA even while calling for boycotting China goods for sometime at least And by selling PSUs as a part of disinvestment  begun by PVN and Manmohan regimes and hastened by Modiled BJP What they did in decades is done in a fast pace by us it is asserted\n\nWhat is new The current parliament building built a century ago has served in shaping India PM Modi said It was built by colonial British rulers and helped shaping a comprador India Now it is being renovated to serve a neocolonial era He added It has undergone several renovations and security and technological upgradations but it has reached its capacity It is now seeking rest\n\nMedia Policy  Selfcensorship is now part of the undeclared Emergency\n\nModis is a remark not just about the building but about the edifice of Indian democracy  It is now seeking rest The old model is slow seeking rest and hence laid to rest The mainstream media largely fell in line followed by the Courts It was established how several recent CJIs served the rulers Prasahant Bhushan had dared and alleged nearly half of the last 1617 CJIs were corrupt and pliable He refused to withdraw his charges\n\nWhile Modis India is pursuing an Atmanirbhar Bhjarat on way to becoming a super power and claims to be the largest democracy  many liberals are not impressed\n\nMany senior editors have left their jobs at various influential media outlets rather they are eased out by the media owners Media was part of democracy it was being said It is now business with all its risks Several senior editors including of EPW were retired and given rest\n\nFear I have not fear I have not Even if all the world opposes me PM Modi quoted Bharati It applies to him and his regime more than ever when it comes to media policy They do not fear but instill fear\n\nWorld Press Freedom Index the Parisbased Reporters Without Borders said that India was 138thranked in the world out of 180 countries measured that was in April 2018 down two positions since 2017 that was lower than countries like Zimbabwe Afghanistan and Myanmar When the index was started in 2002 India was ranked 80th out of 139 countries surveyed As liberalization advanced under Congress and BJP illiberal media policy was gathering pace Then the Index gradually fell to 140 in 2019 and 142 in May 2020 This is how Modis india is now ranked by his democracy allies It was a steep fall from 80 to 142 Yet India claimingly marches ahead with democracy\n\nDeath rape threats from Hindutva zealots\n\nReporters Without Borders had said in 2018 that with Hindu nationalists trying to purge all manifestations of antinational thought from the national debate selfcensorship is growing in the mainstream media and journalists are increasingly the targets of online smear campaigns by the most radical nationalists who vilify them and even threaten physical reprisals\n\nJournalists say that media proprietors who often have multiple kinds of businesses are risk averse and can be leaned on by the government Selfcensorship is part of the undeclared Emergency now in vogue It is a form the ruling classes increasingly adopted ever since Indira Gandhi met her electoral waterloo in late 1970s ModiShah duo perfected it perhaps it is also a part of their Skill India State governments irrespective of the party in power are emulating it Even the LDF in Kerala deployed UAPA encounters media gags There is cooperative federalism with respect to enforcing a police state The Centre is leading the pack of wolves There is no censorship on trolls and threats on social media even while critics are traced and punished\n\nMedia proprietors are notorious for reading the tea leaves they get a clear sense of the tolerance level of politicians in power said senior journalist Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire Government ministers have coined this word presstitute to describe journalists who are unfriendly to them or who dont do their bidding he had said in 2018 Reuters April 27 2018 Now he himself is in trouble\n\nIndia is going through an aggressive variant of McCarthyism against the media said Prannoy Roy cofounder of NDTV Indias first private news channel in 2018 He had a taste of it recently\n\nBharatiyaar wrote that women should walk with their head held high while looking people in the eye Modi quoted Subramanya Bharati Sagarika Ghose a columnist with the Times of India was one woman journalist who dared to see in the eyes of the regime Her experience She said she is viciously trolled for any criticism of the administration  The minute I write something I get droves of hate mail Ghose said I have had death threats and gang rape threats on social media and also through letters sent to my home They know where I live Thousands are paid and employed for this job by many sangh parivar topping the list\n\nMediapersons  writers and Democratic and Human Rights activists are now booked under UAPA and sedition laws\n\nRavish Kumar a news anchor for NDTVs Hindilanguage channel said he has been constantly harassed and threatened by progovernment activists This is very organised he told Reuters They follow me When I go out to report a crowd gathers in 10 minutes\n\nReporters Without Borders counted instances of Indian journalists being killed because of what they write At least three of the journalists murdered in 2017 were targeted in connection with their work it said There were more in later years That was the fate of many including RTI activists\n\nBobby Ghosh the editor of the Hindustan Times one of Indias premier newspapers quit in 2017 September shortly after Modi met its owner Senior journalists familiar with the situation said they were told that Modi was unhappy with Ghoshs editorial policies The journalists told Reuters that Ghosh fell out of favour with the government after he launched a webpage called the Hate Tracker a database of violent crimes based on religion race ethnicity gender or sexual orientation The database was taken down next month in October Ghosh the paper as well as the PMO declined to comment\n\nSenior editor Harish Khare resigned as editorinchief of the widely read Tribune newspaper the same year He told Reuters his relations with the Tribunes controlling trust nosedived after the newspaper published a story exposing flaws in Aadhaar the governments national identity card project The newspapers trust denied and claimed the reporter was in fact rewarded Perhaps it was a parting gift\n\nThe parivar has no fear It is trying all dirty tricks Tamil people had tasted fascism decades ago from Dravidian parties They did not hesitate to manhandle justice Tarkunde in public There was Keelvelmani massacre of 1968 44 dalit laborers killed by landlords haunted for decades and all culprits were finally acquitted Dalits were hunted dalit panchayat presidents were not allowed to sit in office in some places even while selfrespect is mouthed Tamilnadu is witness to love jihad of PMK type Now fascism of Hindutva variety is being brewed\n\nAttempts are being made to form alliances of fascists unify fascists Fascism is fascism secular or communal Southern or northern The language of fascism is the same whether in Tamil or in Hindi The task before Tamilians is to shed fear and resist That is the message of Bharati ironically Modi reminded\n\nThe inputs on media are based on a report by Reuters April 27 2018 It was titled Indian journalists say they are intimidated ostracised if they criticise Modi and the BJP httpsinreuterscomarticleindiapoliticsmediaanalysisidINKBN1HY0AQ \n\nThe writer was a mediaperson\n\nSIGN UP FOR COUNTERCURRENTS DAILY NEWSLETTER"

that different cities in India are known by various brands monikers owing to the USP that each has appropriated and invested in eg ITbased references for Hyderabad Planned Citybased references for Chandigarh City of Light for Kolkata etc I quote from the actual text of the article published on 3rd June Hyderabad cleverly dovetailed its Information Technology IT forays towards Cyberabad Chandigarh remains the quintessential Planned City or City Beautiful Varanasi invokes its timeless antiquity and religiousity to be the mystic the City of Lights Kolkata has amplified its yearround revelry and festivity in a City of Joy that never disappoints etc Even States like Kerala have invested heavily and reaped the benefit of its Gods own country to signify the multitude of religious denominations Just having all the elements of a brand are not enough as they need to be chiseled articulated and creatively posited for public consumption Nowhere was Kolkata referenced as an example of a potentially Valourous city as implied and decried in Prof Sharmas suggestions One can intellectually differ on opinions ie whether to call Jammu The Most Valourous City of India or not but we cannot differ on stated facts as were published\n\nMy limited point of suggesting the rather martialsounding USP for Jammu as opposed to appropriating the City of Temples was that it is a branding nomenclature that has already been appropriated by cities like Varanasi the oldest living city in the world or Madurai  both of a certain antiquity religiousreverence and psychological national imprint that is difficult to outshine as yet another claimant This does not diminish the importance of Jammus temples just as it does not dampen Himachal Pradeshs claims of Dev Bhoomi as also of exactly same branding by Uttarakhand There are simply many too claimants already Though there are no formulaic right or wrong in deciding upon a USP for destination branding as it remains a matter of choice and decision  therefore the author felt that since the potential branding of Most Valourous City of India remains unclaimed is importantly beyond questioning sheer number of gallantry awardees of Indian Armed Forces from Duggar Lands including the HimachalPunjab tracts for whom Jammu remains the epicenter of Dograness and could be a powerful stirring and galvanizing claim that would resonate deeply amongst all proud Indians across the length and breadth of the country Not only could it add the muchneeded weight of a Value Proposition but it also has a sticky rousing and emotional quality about it that would shame the hitherto indifferent citizenry for having ignored such a landpeople who have done so much for the nation selflessly since time immemorial\n\nAs a former combatant who has served in the most unforgiving trying and unreachable frontiers of the country the author does not share the view that the heroics conquests or the raw gallantry of a General Zorawar Singh were any lesser than that of Napoleon the Great as suggested by Prof Sharma  however that too is a matter of perception we could agree to disagree From a purely militaristic perspective to scale dislodge and conquer lands in such punishing topography as was done by General Zorawar Singh requires almost superhuman courage leadership and capabilities Whereas the French have invested assiduously to protect create and even romanticize the imagery of Napoleon which has cemented his definitive iconography and imagery across the world From dramatic paintings idealizing statements to even mythmaking the French created the generouslydashing and cavalier image of a conqueror that successfully suppressed contrary views of historians like Victor Davis Hanson who note rather soberly After all the military record is unquestioned17 years of wars perhaps six million Europeans dead France bankrupt her overseas colonies lost But the French clearly understood the power necessities and urgency of creating striking and resonating brands\n\nBeyond clarifications pertaining to my earlier article and in repositing the rationale for branding JammuDogras with the tag of unmatched valour  I draw from experience of serving along with Dogra troops of various Indian Army Regiments even though I am from the fiery and illustrious Rajput Regiment myself I have always sensed an unsaid humility civility and reclusiveness in soldiers from the Duggar lands that sometimes becomes counterproductive especially for the task on hand The tag of Gentleman Soldiers is indeed a matter of wellearned dignity as these hardy but simple soldiers are second to none in battle The naturally genteel refinement of Duggar soldiers still bore the likes of Maj Somnath Sharma Brig Rajendra Jamwal Subedar Bana Singh Captain Vikram Batra Maj Ajay Jasrotia Captain GS Salaria etc an unending list of valour that importantly cuts across the religiocasteist divides So by extrapolating this psychographic frame onto the entirety of populace  it is unsurprising that the silence of Dogras has been conveniently and imprecisely decoded as that warranting no correction recourse or addressability in the national urgencies Jammu continues to be taken for granted and languishes in desperate need for investments jobopportunities civicinfrastructure etc etc When all other regionalethnic formations across the country are busy vying for national and political attention the voice of concern for the JammuDogras remains unheard in Delhi While the other regions often have a distinct religiocasteist underpinning the Dogra woes are rooted in the constitutional morality of potentially presenting itself as one of unity in diversity There is a clear case to shun the conventional divides that is the instinctive wont of most nationalregional parties as that fragments the inclusiveDogra identity to its disadvantage The fact that I am only married to a very proud Jamwal Dogra and have an outsiders perspective  one wonders at the incredulity and inexplicability as to why JammuDogras who have always punched above their weight for the nation still remain essentially unacknowledged unsung and unrecognised for their stellar performance and achievements Perhaps the starting point is be less harsh critical and diffident about oneself as there is enough and more in terms of powerful assets for JammuDogras to invoke and project unlike the efforts that may have gone for branding Napoleon the Great for themselves  especially since there is a umbilical thread of civilisational nobility and constitutional morality that binds patriotism and unity in diversity both of which JammuDogras have in ample quantity if only they wished to believe so\n\nThe

		"Summary" : "Anil Anand\n\nOver two dozen opposition parties supported the December 8 2020 Bharat Bandh call in support of the farmers protest against three newly enacted farm laws By all means a healthy development for a democracy and given the fact that the opposition has been in tatters and wilting under the might of the BJP\n\nWhat is visible for the last few years is a ruling party with brute majority having its way unmindful of the long term consequences and a totally disarrayed opposition getting weaker by the day This is a phenomenon which is antithesis to what the democracy stands for and it has not happened for the first time in last 70 years A strong ruling party and an equally strong opposition ideally maintain balance in a democratic set up\n\nSo the opposition unity or semblance of it has at last come After supporting the bandh the opposition parties managed to close their ranks without creating much fuss at least visibly and met President of India to present a memorandum regarding the farm laws\n\nIn this backdrop the question that still haunts the public mind is that whether the opposition unity has really arrived Will their leaders truly close their ranks and put a cap on their ambitions to show a united face\n\nAn answer in the right affirmative is still miles away The only difference and silverlining in this latest attempt at opposition unity is that the opposition rank has swelled with some of the NDA allies till recently have also made a common cause on the issue of farmers protests on farm laws In one way this is a healthy development towards achieving a broader opposition unity as it is also a reflection of the BJPs increasing syndrome of ekla chalo Since the ruling party has gained from strength to strength under the powerful leadership of Mr Narendra Modi during the last over six years ostensibly it is unwilling to carry the burden of the allies anymore\n\nThe two of the BJPs oldest allies ever since the NDA was formed Shiromani Akali Dal SAD and Shiv Sena have already parted ways More significantly the SAD under the veteran political leader Mr Parkash Singh Badal quit the NDA on the issue of farm laws although the chasm between the two was growing for quite some time The Shiv Sena which quit the NDA on the issue of Maharashtra chief ministership has since joined hands with the once archrival Congress to head the state government The others who have suddenly discovered a common cause with Congressled opposition are Telengana Rashtriya Samithi TRS of Mr K Chandrashekhaer Rao Mr Naveen Patnaiks Biju Janata Dal Mr Jagan Mohan Reddys YSR Congress and some other smaller regional parties\n\nThis silverlining in the form of greater opposition unity if at all continues beyond the farmers cause will come at a cost unless the leaders of these erstwhile NDA supporting parties enter into the oppositionlock without any condition Of course the reference here is to the individual ambitions of their leaders as many of them visualise themselves as future Prime Ministers There is no dearth of such leaders in the other opposition parties as well\n\nThe one weaklink behind this silverlining is that all these former NDA allies are joining the opposition grouping from a position of weakness They are doing so when their on being abandoned by the big brother BJP\n\nAnother silverlining in this NovemberDecember 2020 opposition unity is the Samajwadi Party SP and Bahujan Samaj Party BSP coming out of the selfimposed political agyatwas or so to say to back the farmers agitation and the bandh call For obvious reasons both SP chief Mr Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Miss Mayawati had been maintaining a studied silence and refrained from criticising the Narendra Modi Government On the contrary they have been obliquely backing the Government Since the two parties are the main force in the opposition ranks in the politically significant Uttar Pradesh their silence has been a great set back to opposition unity\n\nOn paper the scenario for opposition unity seems impressive But it is still a long way off to turn into a reality Personal ambitions of the leaders apart there are still many crossconnections that determine or annihilate the political interests of a particular party or its leader in their respective states or regions The only realisation if it dawns on them that their hegemonic pocketboroughs or areas of political influence are fast melting under the influence of Mr Modi can truly bring them together Or else the BJP despite the questionable policy decisions of its Governments at the Centre and in states and failure to meet the aspirations of the people in relation to the promises held out will continue to have a free run\n\nFor example the assembly poll bound West Bengal is a case study though the phenomenon was not new in terms of forging opposition unity There are three main constituents for the opposition unity in the state namely the Left Block Trinmool Congress and the Congress There seems to be no chance of the three coming together to check the growing influence of the BJP which has already become the main opposition force in the state and has pulled all stops for the assembly elections\n\nThe farmers strike or the Bharat Bandh had created an opportunity for all three to come together However the battlelines for the state assembly elections perhaps prevented them from coming together to meet a bigger challenge and performing a bigger constitutional duty of providing a strong opposition Not to be seen as going along with the Left Block Trinmool Congress though wholeheartedly supporting the farmers agitation decided against supporting the Bharat Bandh to avoid sharing any space wht the Left parties on the streets of Kolkatta on the bandh day\n\nThere is no denying the fact that regional or state leaders such as Miss Banerjee Mr Patnaik and Mr Chandrashekhar Rao owe their political existence to localised power centres But given the fact that they have been playing an important role at the national levels also in this era of coalitions they cannot absolve themselves of their national duty They must realise that only a strong opposition would be able to checkmate the powerful governments in the national interest\n\nThe options for the ilk of these three leaders are absolutely shrinking given the fact that the BJP strategists are more strongly fathoming their own chances in the hitherto unchartered territories such as West Bengal Orissa Tamil Nadu Telengana Punjab Andhra Pradesh etc Miss Banerjee might retain her fortress through a solo effort but even that would not augur well for Trinmool Congresss survival in future And the same is true of other leaders\n\nMore importantly the Congress the only national party in the opposition with a panIndia presence must resolve its own conundrum without any further delay This is for the simple reason no opposition unity is possible either without Congress acting as a fulcrum or the regional players The adversarial goalposts at the regional and state levels should be shifted to create a common goalpost to defend it from the onslaughts of the BJP\n\nfeedbackexcelsiorgmailcom"

		"Summary" : " Provided by Hindustan Times A relative wearing PPE coveralls during the cremation of a person who died of Covid19 at Nigambodh Ghat in New Delhi Raj K RajHT PHOTO\n\nWith 33 new deaths due to coronavirus disease Covid19 reported in Delhi on Sunday the total number of people who have lost their lives to the viral infection in the Capital crossed the 10000 mark  becoming only the fourth state in the country to do so\n\nAs of Sunday the infection has killed a total of 10014 people from the 607454 people infected so far according to government health bulletin\n\nThe grim landmark however comes at the time when the outbreak in the city appears to be under control for the third time Sundays new deaths were the lowest singleday fatalities reported in Delhi in 45 days or since October 29 when 27 new deaths were reported\n\nLos Angeles mayor sounds alarm on rising Covid19 deaths\n\nThe hospital bed occupancy is lowest in three months according to state health minister Satyendar Jain Of the total 18807 hospital beds earmarked for Covid patients in Delhi 4446 are occupied as on Sunday Delhi has the least case fatality ratio at 16 comparatively Ahmedabad is at 40 Mumbai at 38 Kolkata at 2 and Chennai at 18 Because of improved health infrastructure and continued monitoring of home isolation Delhi has been able to achieve 96 recovery rate Jain said in a tweet on Sunday\n\nIn absolute numbers however Delhi remains one of the worsthit regions in the country For every million residents the Capital has seen 505 people die from the viral infection  twice the national average 110 deaths per million population\n\nIndian defence forces to stock weapons ammo for 15day intense war\n\nDelhis case fatality rate CFR  the proportion of confirmed cases that have died due to the disease  is 165 significantly higher than the national CFR of 145 Among the major states only four  Punjab CFR of 317 Maharashtra 257 Gujarat 184 and West Bengal 174  have seen a higher proportion of those infected die from the disease\n\nOn average 53 people have lost their lives to Covid19 every day in the past week This is the lowest the sevenday average of deaths has been in 37 days since November 6 At the peak of the third wave which is currently ebbing 116 people were dying every day on average in Delhi for the week ending November 24 This was the highest death rate since midJune to be sure deaths in this period were artificially inflated as Delhi retrospectively added fatalities that had been erroneously not attributed to Covid19 according to the Delhi government Since then however as cases have declined deaths have been falling as well\n\nDelhi which was one of the earlier hot spots for Indias outbreak is the only region in the country that has seen three distinct waves of infections The first started in midJune and peaked when the sevenday average of daily cases touched around 3400 in the last week of June This receded by the end of July when it dropped to around 1000 daily cases The second wave started at the end of August rising until midSeptember when average daily cases touched 4174 for the week ending September 17 This again dropped to 2574 in the week ending October 9 before the onset of the third wave The third wave raged through October and November leading to the largest surge seen so far The sevenday average of new cases peaked on November 14 when it touched 7341  the highest recorded so far Since then however cases have started receding almost steadily\n\nA Delhi government spokesperson said The people of Delhi have fought a courageous fight against Corona over the last 9 months At 165 Delhis fatality rate is the lowest among all large cities in India The credit goes entirely to our Corona warriors  our doctors nurses paramedics and all health officials who have worked day and night over the last 9 months to save countless lives\n\nExperts say that Delhis low hospital occupancy means that better care can be provided to patients that are critical which means that the number of deaths may remain low in the coming weeks\n\nThe number of deaths recorded per day is slowly going down now And it should be seen with other parameters such as increased tests lower number of new cases surfacing each day and the low positivity rate Overall it shows that the situation has improved It is likely to witness further improvement in the weeks to come Low occupancy rate of hospital beds also reflects that number of severe cases which requires the patients to be hospitalised are decreasing Dr Jugal Kishore head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital said\n\nDelhi however remains one of the most fatal Covid19 regions in the country as experts attributed the relatively high CFR to factors like poor air quality which can worsen the impact of respiratory disease like Covid\n\nCompared to other metropolitan cities such as Mumbai Pune Chennai Bengaluru etc Delhi has a bad air quality problem which contributes to respiratory diseases This year the festive season which witnessed massive crowds across the city coincided with the bad airquality days That period also witnessed extremely high number of cases which eventually led to an increase in the death numbers Secondly Delhi also witnessed high number of cases arriving from other states Most such cases were severe and they arrived very late Such cases contributed to high death toll in the city But the situation seems much better now said Dr Lalit Kant former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper epaperhindustantimescom"

		"Summary" : "Reading Time 6 minutes\n\nAuthors Note Ok so before we get into todays post we have two requests If you like the post and learn something new from it do click on the heart icon Second do share the post with your colleagues friends and family to help us grow \n\nIn India close to 76 of the people in workforce are working without any employment contract And approximately half of these are daily wage earners earning anywhere between 150 INR 2  to 1000 INR 135  per day Hence unlike the more fortunate ones they buy products of daily use food items toiletries etc very frequently either daily or after every 23 days And to reach to this underserved customer base FMCG companies introduced sachets A daily wage earner cannot afford to spend 300 INR 4  on a bottle of shampoo but can buy a 2 INR 25 cents sachet which would last him for 2 days And thats why almost every FMCG product in India toothpaste shampoos detergent hair oil and even coffee has a SKU which is sold in a sachet\n\nBut close to 40 years back most of these FMCG products were sold in large packets and bottles Hence they were only limited to those who were well off There was no concept of sachets back then But a small entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu introduced the concept of sachets to the entire country forcing even the large MNCs to follow suit In the process he ended up building a 500 crores INR shampoo brand called Chik And today almost 70 of the shampoo sales in India happen in sachets\n\nChik Shampoo\n\nIn todays Simplanation we would go through the growth story of Chik its effective marketing and sales strategy\n\nThe Beginning of Chik\n\nIn 1978 Chinnikrishnan an agriculturist also ran a small pharmaceutical business in Cuddalore Tamil Nadu In an attempt to innovate packaging of products he created the concept of sachets First he packed talcum powder into small sachets and started selling them to nearby shops After sometime he also thought that liquid could also be packed in sachets And thats when he started selling shampoos in sachets as well His vision was to make affordable products which could be used by coolies rickshaw pullers and other daily wage earners But he couldnt market these products well He passed away in 1982\n\nThe small business was overtaken by his sons who started a small regional company called Velvette shampoo which sold its products in small parts of Tamil Nadu The youngest brother CK Ranganathan decided to part ways with the brothers in 1983 and started his own cosmetics business with savings of 15000 Rs He started manufacturing shampoo sachets in a small shed and hired two chemistry graduates to work on formulations He named the shampoo Chik priced at 075 INR which was affordable for even the poor daily wage earners His primary target was the south indian rural market In its first month Chik sold 20k sachets\n\nCK Ranganathan The founder of Chik shampoo source Google Images\n\nIn its second year of operations Chik became profitable and started gaining good traction After becoming a common name in the rural markets of TN the company shifted base to Chennai in 1989 and named itself Beauty cosmetics Pvt Ltd By then few other players like HUL and Godrej had also entered this segment but Chik was still much ahead of them in the sachet segment Unlike his family business which was slow to grow CK Ranganathan deployed multiple marketing and sales tactics which helped Chik become a famous brand in the state of Tamil Nadu\n\nMarketing and Sales strategy\n\nThe success of Chic shampoo lies solely in understanding the needs and behavior of their customers well And all their marketing strategies reflect a great empathy for their consumers\n\nFirstly to attract and educate rural customers a lot of whom had never used a shampoo in their life Chik sales staff started running free movie shows in the villages of southern states of India With limited access to any kind of entertainment these free shows drew huge crowds Between the movies they played ads and showed live demonstration of using a Chik shampoo They also gave free sachets to audience to try This helped them gain a great brand awareness to the extent that the name became synonymous with the shampoo category\n\nWith bigger FMCG players entering around 1988 Chik adopted an innovative scheme where a customer could return 5 sachets of any shampoo to a retailer and get a Chik Sachet free The scheme was later altered where they started giving a free shampoo in exchange of sachets of only Chik Shampoo The price sensitive customers started buying only Chik Shampoo Though the scheme was discontinued after 10 months the habit of the customers continued This scheme worked wonders for the company with sales almost doubling to 10 lacs sachets per month in just an years time The turnover crossed 1 crore INR in 1989\n\nIn 1990 the company launched two variants with floral fragrances rose and jasmine In the southern part of the country women typically decorate their hair with jasmine flowers This move again worked very well for Chic and they tripled their sales to 30 lac sachets per month by 1991 All these efforts bore fruit and Chic became the number one shampoo brand in South India\n\nExpanding to other parts of the country was a tougher challenge given that Chik was famous only in the southern part of the country So it wanted that the distributors push their products more to the wholesalers and retailers and the retailers display Chik in more prominent parts of the store and ask the customers to buy this new product Hence they started offering the distributors and retailers 12 extra margins compared to the competition The competition brands didnt want to give up on their margins and hence decided to stick to the older structure This helped Chic grow some good traction in other parts of the country as well By 1992 the annual revenue of the company had reached 12 crores INR\n\nIn 1998 the companys name was changed to Cavin Kare Cavin means beauty in Tamil from Beauty Cosmetics In 1998 the company had a market share of around 6 The shampoo sachets from most of the companies used to cost between 1 and 2 INR Basis the consumer research they found that still a good segment of customers were not buying shampoos because they found the price point costly So they launched a 050 INR shampoo in 1998 which became a blockbuster hit By 2003 Chik had become the second largest national brand in India with 22 market share just a little below HULs Clinic Plus The revenues had reached close to 200 crores INR by 2003\n\nPositioning Handicap\n\nChik was always known for being a low cost shampoo With more demand for premium shampoos like Sunsilk Dove etc Chik also tried to upgrade its positioning by launching Chik Satin as a premium product But given the associated brand image it was very difficult to extend the same into premium shampoos as well Hence the new product was a failure With this handicap of positioning Chiks growth plateaued and other brands started growing through premiumization One more trend that Chik couldnt catchup on was the introduction of anti dandruff shampoos which went on to become 25 of the total market size by 2011 Chik did not introduce any anti dandruff shampoo Chiks market share had gone down from 22 in 2003 to a mere 5 in 2011\n\nBut even today Chik is a famous brand in the rural parts of the country which made sachets so popular that almost every FMCG product has a sachet version today Today it clocks close to 500 crores INR in revenues every year  is the biggest brand of the 2000 crores INR Cavin Kare group Apart from the shampoo company launched some more interesting products like Spintz perfume sold in 10 INR bottle and Fairever cream with Kesar saffron which also became big hits Today the group has over 100 products in FB and personal care space Chik did manage to introduce sachets on a large scale making daily use products affordable for millions But at the same time these sachets have been one of the major causes for pollution of rivers and landfills And thats something that both the company and the society should have been thoughtful about\n\nOk before I finish I got to know one more interesting point that I never really noticed The per unit price per ml price in a shampoo sachet is always cheaper than the per unit price in a shampoo bottle And the same hold true for other products as well Ever thought why is that the case  Do share your thoughts in the comments \n\nREFERENCES"

		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : " Provided by The Indian Express\n\nIn the Mamata Banerjeeled West Bengal governments refusal to send three IPS officers on central deputation there is an echo of a similar refusal by then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in 2001\n\nIn the current instance the Centre has asked for the three IPS officers to be sent on deputation with the Government of India following an attack on BJP president J P Naddas motorcade outside Kolkata these officers were in charge of security In its refusal the West Bengal government has cited a shortage of IPS officers The Indian Express December 13\n\nThe Tamil Nadu parallel\n\nJayalalithaa took oath as Chief Minister on May 13 2001 On the night of June 2930 Tamil Nadu polices CBCID raided former Chief Minister M Karunanidhis home and arrested him along with his DMK colleagues Murasoli Maran and T R Baalu then ministers in the NDA government of A B Vajpayee  Follow Express Explained on Telegram\n\nIt resulted in the removal of Governor Fathima Beevi as the Centre was not happy with her report Then Law Minister Arun Jaitley said the report did not reflect the true situation in Tamil Nadu today and that the Governor had wholly failed to discharge her constitutional obligations\n\nThree IPS officers were identified as involved in the raid then Chennai Police Commissioner K Muthukaruppan Joint Commissioner Sebastian George and Deputy Commissioner Christopher Nelson Considered close to Jayalalithaa all of them have since retired After retirement Nelson was appointed as Member of the State Planning Commission and later as the state Information Commissioner\n\nIn West Bengal the officers the Centre has sought on central deputation are Rajeev Mishra Additional Director General South Bengal Praveen Tripathi Deputy Inspector General Presidency Range and Bholanath Pandey SP Diamond Harbour\n\nAs is happening now the Home Ministry then under Lal Krishna Advani had asked the Tamil Nadu government to relieve the three officers for central deputation Jaitley had said the Centre had overriding powers in the transfer of IPS officers The decision was taken in a meeting of the Union Cabinet and Attorney General Soli Sorabjee was asked to cut short a London trip to attend it\n\nJayalalithaa then like Mamata Banerjee now refused to spare those officers She wrote to other Chief Ministers for their support to protect the rights of the states She wrote about the disturbing trend in the management of the state cadres of All India Services and CentreState relations While declining the Centres demand she had said like Mamata said on Saturday that there was already a dearth of good officers in the state which needed those officers\n\nWhat the rules say\n\nFor the premier civil services  IAS IPS and Indian Forest Service  officers of the state cadre are allotted by the Centre from a pool of officers From time to time a certain number of officers are sent on central deputation The Home Ministry is the authority in control of IPS cadre the Department of Personnel and Training for the IAS cadre and the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change for IFS cadre\n\nMuthukaruppan told The Indian Express on Sunday I cannot comment on what the central government can do against the West Bengal officers but we approached CAT Central Administrative Tribunal which stayed the Home Ministry order None of us tried for central deputation since 2001 There was no other action by the central government against us\n\nThe Centre can take no action against civil service officials who are posted under the state government Rule 7 of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules 1969 states that the Authority to institute proceedings and to impose penalty will be the state government if the officer is serving in connection with the affairs of a State or is deputed for service under any company association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the Government of a State or in a local authority set up by an Act of the Legislature of that State For any action to be taken on an officer of the All India Services IAS IPS IFS the state and the Centre both need to agree\n\nRule 61 of the Indian Police Service Cadre Rules 1954 says about deputation in case of any disagreement the matter shall be decided by the central Government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the Central Government\n\nCoronavirus Explained\n\nClick here for more\n\nUnder the Home Ministrys deputation policy for IPS officers if an officer on offer is selected for a Central posting and does not report either on his own or at the instance of the State Government he would be debarred for consideration for a post under the Government of India for a period of five years Officers who have already been debarred should not be offered before the debarment period is over Being debarred from central deputation however hardly bothers an official if they prefer to work in their state\n\nAnother episode in February last year was a pointer to the Centres limitations in acting against All India Service officers The Home Ministry had written to then Chief Secretary Malay Kumar De calling for action against five officers including DGP Virendra for allegedly taking part in a dharna organised by the Trinamool Congress The state government however said no officer had taken part in the dharna"
