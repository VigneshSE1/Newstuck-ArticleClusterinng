		"Summary" : "They say sales and distribution SD is a game meant only for big FMCG companies But with several challenger brands coming to the fore and making it big in ecommerce smaller brands have realised that physical retail business simply cannot be ignored in India\n\n\n\n\n\nAnKa SumMor founded by Ashok George and Rajiv Joshi in 2015 provides challenger brands the combined power of a large brand\n\nOur SD platform is for multiple challenger brands thereby solving their SD challenges of scale information and intelligence to optimally cater to demand at a reduced cost For this brands have to realise that not conventional distribution margin but their overall SD costs should be the benchmark This platform will help significantly reduce SD cost Also this notion of control needs to be questioned What use is control without information and intelligence remarks Rajiv\n\nThe startup is a single SD partner platform for brands in a city servicing all relevant retail channelsoutlets The platform services upcountry subdistributors eliminating the need for carrying and forwarding agents The challenger brands directly supply to AnKa SumMor warehouses resulting in lower logistics costs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frontline sales team on AnKa SumMor works with various brands and eliminates the challenges of deploying managing and retaining teams independently The platform claims to help brands with transparent order and sales information at any retail outlet level and in the process help plan the secondary sales for the brand The platform improves order fill rates and lowers market expiries in six months\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in revenue doubling in nine to 12 months and there would be no trade scheme leakage there will also be a reduction of SD costs up to 50 percent says Ashok George\n\nThe early days\n\nThe founders have known each other for over 20 years now and have worked together at CocaCola and Mother Dairy in the past The duo has a combined experience of over five decades in the SD and logistics industry especially in the FMCG industry\n\n\n\n\n\nThe founders say the problem of finding managing and retaining distributors has been a constant challenge coupled with the complexity of deploying and managing a large frontline sales team\n\nIn spite of all the effort and investment the FMCG SD system was always about fulfilling brand growth goals We knew that in other parts of the world SD was a separate business For instance the CocaCola company does not bottle or distribute the brands directly but has anchor bottlers Mother Dairys strength came from its direct supplies to its booths which was not the case the moment the company had to supply to retail says Rajiv\n\nRajiv Joshi Cofounder AnKa SumMor\n\nThe existing FMCG SD system in India is multilayered and fragmented For instance even big brands like HUL Amul Britannia Nestle and ITC have multiple distributors in any large city This works for them as they have managed to create demand for their brands resulting in significant revenue for each distributor\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever these same brands struggle with their long tail as the SD system is geared to sell and distribute what sells Imagine the plight of the No 3 4 or 5 challenger FMCG brands in the category For one large distributors are not interested due to lower demand and this results in lower revenue lower working capital rotation and more importantly higher damage and expiry in the market visàvis the large brands Two small distributors do not make enough margin to support a salesman resulting in the brand having to deploy their own frontline sales teams and this becomes expensive Also lack of sufficient infrastructure and working capital to support growth coupled with a high rate of logistics and distributor attrition can lead to the brand being weakened and unable to compete with large brands\n\n\n\n\n\nSD costs for these challenger FMCG brands are two to three times that of a large brand leaving them with very little room to invest in the growth of the brand Moreover with all these costs challenger brands do not have any visibility on order and sales from distributors to retailers which results in trade scheme leakages and poor SKU assortment along with damages and expiry The brands future is decided by the distributor and frontline salesman a system that leads to the creation of large brands\n\n\n\n\n\nAll experiments in FMCG SD systems are limited to a Master Distributor and Sub Distributor model which works only for big brands\n\nNew brands did not want to be stuck in a system that was created by bigger brands They were willing to take a leap of faith so came onboard with AnKa SumMor and have now clearly seen the benefit says Rajiv\n\nThe business model\n\nThe platform was funded and incubated by Fireside Ventures\n\nThe biggest challenge was the high cost of operations stabilising endtoend sales force automation sales projections and creating trust at retail during the first year where the scale was still low for the infrastructure and resources deployed says Ashok George\n\n\n\n\n\nAnKa SumMor has an inventory and working capital SD Model where ownership of stocks move to AnKa SumMor Their revenues are sales to retail and they get SD margins on the same Since the startup buys a stock at a discounted rate the discounts become their margins\n\nAll infrastructure for storage and delivery is hired and fixed manpower is on company roles Since most of the operating costs are fixed to semivariable revenue scale coupled with productivity enhancing technology will bring down operating cost as a percentage of revenue says Rajiv\n\nThe founders have invested over Rs 20 lakh in building the business from scratch The startup has raised Rs 6 crore in a Seed round from Fireside Ventures It has big plans over the next 18 months\n\n\n\n\n\nWe intend to raise Rs 13 crore in a combination of equity and debt during this year to fund our expansion to Bengaluru in early 2021 and increase infrastructure at Hyderabad and Chennai The goal is to service 15000 relevant outlets in these three cities by March 2022 We want to be profitable and generate Rs 100 crore revenue over the next two years Subsequently we want to raise Rs 100 crore to expand to the other metros and Tier I cities in India with a distribution reach of 100000 relevant outlets and plan to become a pan India operation in FY 2025 says Rajiv\n\nAshok George Cofounder of AnKa SumMor\n\nHe adds the startup will be further investing in deploying technology tools to automate warehouse and delivery operation and build an inhouse data analytics engine This will help create a recommendation engine to improve productivity at all levels and impact revenue growth for our brand partners besides reducing operating costs and improving profitability\n\n\n\n\n\nThe startup will continue to provide market insights for brands to leverage while developing consumer connectdemand for their customers by providing them data for hyper local marketing activities It will add merchandising and promoter services to become a complete Go to Market solution for challenger brands It will also create regional storage and logistics hubs for brand partners to improve stock rotation and lower logistics cost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brand currently directly services 2100 outlets in Hyderabad and Chennai and service over 20 subdistributors in Telangana and Chennai They intend to expand their reach to 5000 outlets in Hyderabad and Chennai by March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nThe startups revenues was Rs 18 crore in 2020 and is expecting to close FY 2021 at Rs 24 crore The company competes with Mobisy Technologies and JumboTail Avendus predicts that D2C brands will have a 100 billion market by 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are nearly 600 D2C brands in India and with the support of platforms like AnKa SumMor these brands will see massive growth in the coming years"

		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "A potential limitation of largescale trials is that some of the nuance pertaining to sitespecific context can be lost during analysis This will be address by including local researchers from a range of sites across the three study countries\n\nThis study will be one of the first process evaluations of an adequately powered trial of a pragmatic lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitusprediabetes prevention in women with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM within resourceconstrained environments\n\nThe overall aim of this process evaluation is to evaluate and understand what worked and why during the implementation of the LIVING intervention In addition this study aims to provide additional information that will assist in the interpretation of the LIVING Study results This study will address this aim by\n\nAn essential component of the intervention involves taskshifting a strategy involving the redistribution of tasks among health workforce teams described elsewhere 16 Our implementation strategy reflects a withinsystem taskshifting approach whereby the intervention is delivered by auxiliary nurse midwives or their equivalent hereafter called facilitators in each participating hospital Facilitators will have undergone training and will be equipped with educational materials in local languages including a facilitator manual with a session guide for each group session\n\nThe intervention comprises of 4 facetoface group sessions 84 automated text or prerecorded voice messages a participant manual monthly phone calls and 2 intensification sessions in the event that weight goals are not achieved within 6 months of the commencement of the intervention The LIVING Study process evaluation conducted alongside the RCT will inform policy and decision makers about the reasons why and the mechanisms through which the intervention worked and whether the intervention is likely to be generalisable and scalable in realworld contexts\n\nThe Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes LIVING Study is a randomised controlled trial RCT of a lowintensity lifestyle modification programme tailored to women with GDM in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka The multiple interacting components of this complex intervention were informed by several successful studies in the prevention of T2DM and weight gain which have been described elsewhere 1114 The multicentre study is being undertaken over 60 months December 2015 to December 2020 15 A total of 1414 women with prior GDM will be recruited from a total of up to 24 hospitals in these three countries Women are recruited into the study in pregnancy to assess for GDM and 318 months postchildbirth if diagnosed with GDM in the index pregnancy to assess glycaemic status for eligibility to participate in the trial Women eligible for participation in the trial are therefore randomised to the control or intervention group 318 months after childbirth Women are excluded from the trial if travel time to hospital is greater than 2 hours a household mobile telephone is not available if steroids are used during pregnancy or if they are likely to move residence in the next 3 years Followup visits are conducted for all participants every 6 months from the data of randomisation The intervention is designed to take 4852 weeks from randomisation to have all of its components delivered Further detail on the inclusion and exclusion criteria the calculation of the number of subjects and how they will be recruited is in the main trial protocol 15 The primary outcome of the randomised trial is the proportion of women with a change of glycaemic category at or prior to the final visit 1 normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose IFG or impaired glucose tolerance IGT or T2DM and 2 IFG or IGT to T2DM The secondary outcomes of the study include change in body weight waist circumference blood pressure fasting blood glucose physical activity level and diet 15 The main trial outcomes will not be analysed in the process evaluation However we will present figures related to the study processes for example duration between childbirth and glycaemic status assessment duration of the intervention and intervals between followup visits\n\nIn India up to 25 of the 25 million pregnancies occurring each year are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM and this proportion is rapidly increasing 13 Prevalence estimates using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups in Sri Lanka 23 are similar and in Bangladesh 10 are somewhat lower 4 5 Prior GDM is an established risk factor for the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 6 Systematic review evidence using international and specified local criteria indicates a sevenfold greater risk for T2DM conversion in women with GDM compared with normoglycaemic pregnancies 7 Further 3560 of Indian women with GDM will develop T2DM or prediabetes within 5 years of childbirth more than double the rate observed in largely White populations 811 Onset of T2DM is preventable or can be delayed through sustained changes to diet exercise and selfcare proactively engaging in activities to preserve and improve health Yet to date there have been no completed adequately powered trials of interventions to demonstrate such an effect in South Asian women\n\nMethods and analysis\n\nPatient and public involvement Patients were involved in the design and conduct of this research The LIVING intervention builds on the prior HeLPher and PregDiabCare Programmes17 18 HeLPher is a lowintensity lifestyle programme designed to prevent persistent postpartum weight gain among ethnically diverse Australian women Key features of this programme include nonprescriptive simple health messages small changes to behaviour low participant burden and intervention delivery including a mix of group sessions phone and short message service text reminders The intervention was associated with a significant weight difference 1 kg between intervention and control groups favouring the former PregDiabCare comprised of only six group sessions focused on diet and physical activity with implementation in two Indian hospitals providing with preliminary evidence of feasibility and effectiveness Building on these prior interventions the LIVING Programme was developed through a process of formative research The formative research was conducted in two hospitals in each of North and South India Bangladesh and one from Sri Lanka and included document analysis process mapping semistructured interviews and focus group discussions with all key stakeholders healthcare providers patients and advisers to policymakers We used these data from this formative research and the theoretical models described above to identify which barriers and enablers needed to be addressed as well as what modifications and combinations of HeLPher and PregDiabCare would be most likely to target such barriers and facilitators The UK Medical Research Council MRC provides guidance on implementing and evaluating complex interventions The guidelines advocate for the use of theory in order to explain specific elements of the intervention and the avenues through which it may work Contributors to MRC guidance contend that this is vital to building an evidence base that informs policy and practice19 20\n\nMethodological approaches informing our evaluation framework The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance REAIM framework will be used to inform the LIVING Studys process evaluation framework21 The REAIM framework consists of five dimensions of healthrelated behaviour interventions reach to the target population effectiveness of the intervention adoption by the intended recipients of the intervention staff and institutions such as hospitals implementation including consistency of implementation and costs and maintenance of the intervention effects in specific settings over time19 These five dimensions aim to encourage researchers evaluators and policymakers to identify the elements of health interventions that improve adoption implementation and sustainability The REAIM framework was considered highly suitable as the LIVING Programme was designed with the intention of broader adoption and implementation into policy and practice in the South Asian context and has been used to design our evaluation framework figure 1 Figure 1 Process Evaluation Framework for the LIVING intervention to prevent or delay or delay onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM in women with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM FGDs focus group discussions LIVING Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes RCT randomised controlled trial SMS short message service\n\nTheories informing our research tools Two highly complementary theories Michies Behaviour Change Theory and Normalisation Process Theory NPT table 1 are used to guide the design of our qualitative tools eg semistructured discussion schedules within the overall evaluation framework figure 122 23 Table 1 Data collection tools and frameworks used to address process evaluation objectives The LIVING intervention has been designed to build the capacity and motivation of women to make small achievable changes to their lifestyle Thus we required a theory that would take a complex multilayered approach to understanding individuals behaviour change and ideally leverage the strengths and address the limitations of a plethora of other behaviour change frameworks22 Michies Theory is ideal in this regard as it consolidates key behaviour change frameworks and includes a Capability Opportunity MotivationBehaviour COMB Model Capability investigates individuals physical and psychological capability This includes knowledge skills and tools Opportunity refers to the social and physical opportunities available to the individual to perform a behaviour Motivation refers to the level of motivation as well as unconscious habits and conscious thoughts and goals that influence behaviour in reflective and automatic ways The behaviour component looks at the type of behaviour sought which is shaped by capability opportunity and motivation These sources of behaviour are positioned within a wheel with the outer layers acknowledging the influence of intervention functions eg enablement training persuasion and education and policy categories eg guidelines fiscal measures and legislation However the limitation of Michies Behaviour Change Theory is that it is best suited to individual behaviour change rather than organisational change The third objective of this process evaluation is to evaluate whether the intervention is scalable and sustainable within a realworld setting Thus we required a conceptual framework to understand how the LIVING interventions withinsystem taskshifting and new ways of organising and delivering healthcare would be adopted implemented and practised NPT is ideal as it is targeted at understanding the collective action and organisational behaviour required to introduce complex interventions to healthcare settings The theory uses four constructs representing the work involved in establishing a new practice coherence cognitive participation collective action and reflexive monitoring Coherence refers to the sensemaking work people undertake as individuals and collectively in order to operationalise new practices Cognitive participation is the relational work done to sustain a community of practice from introducing a new practice called the initiation phase to defining the actions and procedures required to sustain a practice called activation Collective action refers to the operational work done to enact a set of practices eg considering workability and context Reflexive monitoring is the appraisal work people do to assess and understand how new practices affect them and others around them23 NPT will be used to inform the semistructured interviews with service providers eg health workers and management staff Together the two theoretical frameworks will allow the research team to study the specific causal mechanisms through which the intervention seeks to make change as well as the extent to which it is effective and acceptable adopted by healthcare organisations implemented as intended and has the capacity to be scaled up and sustained see figure 1 for evaluation framework\n\nThe LIVING Study process evaluation framework The evaluation framework figure 1 demonstrates each of the intervention components and the relationships among them First the framework incorporates the intervention components addressing assumed causal mechanisms These causal mechanisms explained in detail in our logic model figure 2 are intended to make it easier to understand why the intervention will work and to facilitate external scrutiny of their plausibility These assumptions are underpinned by the key elements of Michies Behaviour Change Theory and COMB model capability opportunity and motivation Thus it also serves to test the applicability and robustness of the theory in the context of lifestyle change in women with prior GDM in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Second the framework incorporates implementation factors eg reach and recruitment fidelity and dose as well as adoption and implementation mechanisms of impact eg effectiveness acceptability and maintenance and finally the outcomes of the trial to be assessed at the end of the study Figure 2 Logic model for the LIVING intervention to prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM in women with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM LIVING Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes A mixedmethods design will be used to investigate the components of our process evaluation framework This will involve the integration of both qualitative and quantitative data in the research process including evaluation datasets administratively collected process data accessed during monitoring visits check lists and logs filled at intervention sites audit reports quantitative participant evaluation surveys semistructured interviews and focus group discussions Evaluation datasets data from participants will be collected at randomisation and 6 monthly intervals thereafter with oral glucose tolerance tests and HbA1c tests alternately conducted at the followup 6 monthly visits and both tests at the endofstudy visit These assessments will include anthropometry as well as surveys of physical activity and diet using validated questionnaires Administrative data data indicating eligibility and reasons for ineligibility will be used to assess generalisability of the intervention Monitoring at least one every 6 months will be conducted by central study staff to ensure compliance with the protocol and any local requirements During each visit the study monitors will fill in a monitoring report on record maintenance conduct of sessions and implementation of the programme and offer feedback to ensure consistency of the implementation The voicetext messaging report will indicate the number of successful messages sent every month as well as whether the voice message was heard completely or disconnected early Programme checklists and logbooks programmespecific checklists were developed in conjunction with the research team records to assess implementation fidelity recruitment intervention delivery and programme context Intervention session logs documenting attendance collection of feedback and participation of group members will also be analysed Programme auditing the delivery of the group sessions will be audited by direct observation remote observation or audio or video recording These data will be analysed alongside the intervention session logs and checklists All four sessions will be observed for the first group at each site and one of any of the four sessions will be observed for all group sessions thereafter Quantitative participant evaluation survey a barriers and facilitators evaluation survey administered after the fourth and final group session at approximately 6 months after randomisation will be undertaken to explore what women have found to be enabling and what challenging in executing lifestyle modification following the group sessions Surveys will list potential barriers to physical activity and healthy eating as well as facilitators Survey items are informed by the formative research as well as findings from previously conducted diabetes prevention programmes Participants will also be able to mention barriers and enablers that are not listed in the evaluation form Semistructured interviews and group discussions semistructured interviews and group discussions will be conducted with a subgroup of participants allocated to the intervention arm of the RCT staff and stakeholders at the end of the study Interviews will also be conducted using a maximum variation sampling technique to ensure that diverse opinions are gained from healthcare workers hospital administrators and representatives of relevant government agencies with broad representation across the three countries Group session evaluation form all women who attend group sessions will fill out a feedback form at the end of each session They will score their overall experience of the intervention session including feedback on intervention content its presentation as well as the facilitators skills and behaviour In table 1 above we describe how each of the data collection tools listed within the evaluation framework will be used\n\nEvaluating whether and how the intervention had impact for whom and why Surveys The barriers and facilitators evaluation survey online supplemental appendix A and group session evaluation form online supplemental appendix B will help us understand what aspects of womens lives including their living conditions structural issues and level of support available are preventing them from achieving changes and which aspects of the intervention they found useful for example selfmotivation scheduling social support and information Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp001pdf Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp002pdf The group session evaluation form will explore whether the topics covered in the sessions were relevant to participants whether they felt that the trainer was well prepared whether the time allotted for the session was sufficient and whether the content was organised and easy to follow Evaluation datasets These data will be used to quantitatively evaluate effectiveness eg percent change in outcome variables at the end of the trial These data will be used to compare characteristics of intensification and nonintensification participants to identify any trends in whom the intervention was most effective or least effective for Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions Semistructured interviews see online supplemental appendix C for interview schedule and focus group discussions see online supplemental appendix D for discussion schedule will seek to gain a deeper understanding of the themes underpinning the surveys described above From the interviews we expect to understand participants individual experiences of the intervention while focus groups will be used to understand the similarities and differences in womens experiences In addition they will seek to address its gaps eg themes that participants raise in the surveys that were not listed by intervention developers in the preformulated survey tool These data will contribute to a deeper understanding of what participants and the health workers delivering the intervention think the causal mechanisms are as well as their general attitudes towards the intervention The discussions will include a specific focus on how from the perspectives of the participants and the health workers the intervention impacts elements of Michies Behaviour Change Theory that is womens capability opportunity and motivation Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp003pdf Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp004pdf\n\nEvaluating whether the trial was implemented appropriately and as planned In order to investigate the fidelity of the trial that is whether the components of the trial were delivered as intended and in appropriate detail this process evaluation will use mixed methods Routine monitoring data eg estimated number exposed to recruitment percent screened for eligibility percent ineligible for participation actual number eligible and actual number who participated and evaluation datasets will be used to assess reach whether the intended audience came into contact with the intervention and how To assess implementation and whether poor implementation limited the effects of the intervention we will use trial administration data including the actual number of phone calls text messages received and sessions attended The group session observation checklist online supplemental appendix E data obtained from programme auditing as well as other administrative data collection tools mentioned above will assess the management of group dynamics the transmission and emphasis of key messages the provision of all intervention materials and the participation of the group members Supplemental material bmjopen2020037774supp005pdf In addition pretraining and posttraining assessment of facilitators will be undertaken to evaluate their training and all facilitators will participate in a selfassessment wheel We will use these data to understand how facilitators carried out their roles and responsibilities These data will be supplemented with semistructured interviews and group discussions with participants and facilitators The discussions will seek to understand from various perspectives issues of fidelity and dose see online supplemental appendices C and D for discussion schedules\n\nEvaluating whether the results of the study are generalisable scalable and sustainable A third objective of this process evaluation will be to ascertain whether the intervention is generalisable and scalable Our theoretical framework will allow researchers evaluators and policymakers to pinpoint how the intervention with reference to the key components of each theory incorporated into our framework can be scaled up in India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well as tailored to other contexts Focus groups and semistructured interviews will be used to understand the barriers and enablers to implementation In addition they will seek to understand how the complex intervention was embedded in organisational contexts as the result of individual and collective work to implement the programme We will investigate the extent to which the integration of the programme achieved coherence cognitive participation collective action and reflexive monitoring as well as how it might be expected that this will continue in the future and in other contexts Finally using semistructured interviews with key stakeholders in decisionmaking and management we will enquire about the extent to which current guidelines environmental social planning fiscal measures and legislation regulation and service provision are conducive to the scaleup and sustainability of the intervention at each site\n\nSampling Participants for the interviews and group discussions will be recruited using maximum variation purposive sampling Of the 1414 women diagnosed with GDM recruited for the study approximately half will receive the intervention All data collection methods listed above with the exception of the interviews and focus group discussions will involve women in the intervention arm of the trial For interviews and focus group discussions 6080 women with GDM including those that were due to receive the intervention but did not attend any sessions will be recruited at each of the sites in the North India South India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka regions to participate in the process evaluation Evaluation data session feedback and data from the barriers and facilitators survey will be obtained from each of the participants in the intervention For the semistructured interviews we will recruit 10 women from each of the four regions arriving at a total of 40 participants We will also recruit a facilitator site investigator project and hospital management staff and policymaker from each of the four regions totalling 20 interview participants For the focus group discussions with participants we will recruit five women from each of the four regions arriving at a total of 20 participants In total we will recruit 6080 interview and focus group discussion participants We anticipate that this sample size will be sufficient to achieve thematic saturation based on previous GDM studies In the event that thematic saturation has not been reached we will increase our sample of participants Participants will be recruited by the local site staff and where relevant reasons for not participating will be elicited Written consent will be obtained for the interviews and group discussions\n\nAnalysis plan The quantitative data collected as part of this process evaluation will include checklists logs and feedback surveys Descriptive statistics will be generated for these data The study outcome data including change in glycaemic status weight waist circumference diet and physical activity will be analysed in the main trial15 All interviews and group discussions will be audio recorded and transcribed We will undertake thematic analysis of all qualitative data moving from codes to categories and finally themes24 Data analysis will be conducted contemporaneously with data collection until thematic saturation has been achieved The development of the coding framework will be informed by the REAIM framework as well as the two theories Michies Behaviour Change Theory and NPT that have informed our interview and discussion schedules The analysis team JS LKJ DK and DP and their research assistants will consist of public health researchers with experience working in the South Asian region from nutrition health and legal backgrounds Members of the analysis team have been trained within institutions The George Institute for Global Health and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences with extensive experience in undertaking process evaluations alongside RCTs developing and monitoring internal research practices that meet the highest standards of research integrity and ethics The analysts will establish themes under the headings of the evaluation framework context causal mechanisms implementation mechanisms of impact and outcomes Given that the process evaluation is testing a hypothesised causal pathway described in the logic modelfigure 2 the analysis will aim to scrutinise the extent to which our logic model predicted the actual impact of the intervention and also identify unexpected mechanisms To triangulate data the analysis team will engage in constant iterative comparison among data from various stakeholders eg auxiliary nurse midwives participants and management staff Our analysis will identify components of the intervention implementation and outcomes associated with a large degree of agreement as well as identify any differences in experiences and perspectives among stakeholders Data from other sources listed in the framework including administratively collected process data and survey data will be used to triangulate themes Quantitative data will help inform fidelity and dose as described in the previous section The framework will aid in triangulating qualitative and quantitative findings as well as identifying the relationships among context implementation mechanisms of impact and outcomes Data analyses will be ongoing and process data will be analysed independently of the outcome evaluation data before the two sets of data are combined Data will also be triangulated to increase the reliability of results using the multiple perspectives of analysts based in India Bangladesh Sri Lanka and Australia and the diverse disciplinary social sciences medical legal and cultural backgrounds of the analysts In addition at least one analyst JS has not been involved in the development of the intervention and as such we anticipate that this independent perspective will help to triangulate data and ensure the reliability of our results\n\nStrengths and limitations A major strength of this study is that it will be one of the first process evaluations of an adequately powered trial of a pragmatic lifestyle intervention for T2DMprediabetes in women with GDM within resourceconstrained environments In addition the evaluation will be conducted from the perspectives of women participants facilitators site investigators and project management staff using two highly complementary theories Michies Behaviour Change Theory and NPT A potential limitation of large scale trials is that some of the nuance pertaining to contextual factors language cultural norms and site specifics may be lost during analysis and data management These limitations will be address by involving local researchers from a variety of sites across the three study countries during different periods of the study to enhance the reliability of the findings An additional limitation is that women participating in the process evaluation will be recruited by facilitators at each study site which may result in selection bias In addition an unintended consequence of our interview schedules being theoryinformed may be that we miss factors eg other than capability opportunity and motivation impacting participants ability to make changes to their lifestyle We will address this by including openended questions\n\nEthics and dissemination All participants in discussions related to the process evaluation will be given information about the study and their consent obtained Ethics approval to conduct this research has been obtained from the University of Sydney New South Wales Australia Additional sitespecific ethics approval has been at each local site in the three countries India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka This includes approvals from the Institutional Ethics Committee at King Edwards Memorial Hospital Maharaja Agrasen Hospital Centre for Disease Control New Delhi Goa Medical College Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research Madras Diabetes Research Foundation Christian Medical College Vellore Fernandez Hospital Foundation Castle Street Hospital for Women University of Kelaniya Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital Birdem General Hospital and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research In line with ethics requirements data will be stored by The George Institute for Global Health on a storage platform shared drive only accessible by the research team The audio recordings will be transcribed by a professional transcription service The transcription service will sign a confidentiality agreement To ensure the anonymity of participants individual identifiers will be removed from the data Direct identifiers eg name and address and indirect eg date of birth profession will be removed during the transcription process Data will be retained for a minimum of 7 years after completion of the project"

		"Summary" : "Jayalalithaa and Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi in 2012 Express Archive\n\nIn the Mamata Banerjeeled West Bengal governments refusal to send three IPS officers on central deputation there is an echo of a similar refusal by then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in 2001\n\nIn the current instance the Centre has asked for the three IPS officers to be sent on deputation with the Government of India following an attack on BJP president J P Naddas motorcade outside Kolkata these officers were in charge of security In its refusal the West Bengal government has cited a shortage of IPS officers The Indian Express December 13\n\nThe Tamil Nadu parallel\n\nJayalalithaa took oath as Chief Minister on May 13 2001 On the night of June 2930 Tamil Nadu polices CBCID raided former Chief Minister M Karunanidhis home and arrested him along with his DMK colleagues Murasoli Maran and T R Baalu then ministers in the NDA government of A B Vajpayee\n\nIt resulted in the removal of Governor Fathima Beevi as the Centre was not happy with her report Then Law Minister Arun Jaitley said the report did not reflect the true situation in Tamil Nadu today and that the Governor had wholly failed to discharge her constitutional obligations\n\nThree IPS officers were identified as involved in the raid then Chennai Police Commissioner K Muthukaruppan Joint Commissioner Sebastian George and Deputy Commissioner Christopher Nelson Considered close to Jayalalithaa all of them have since retired After retirement Nelson was appointed as Member of the State Planning Commission and later as the state Information Commissioner\n\nIn West Bengal the officers the Centre has sought on central deputation are Rajeev Mishra Additional Director General South Bengal Praveen Tripathi Deputy Inspector General Presidency Range and Bholanath Pandey SP Diamond Harbour\n\nAs is happening now the Home Ministry then under Lal Krishna Advani had asked the Tamil Nadu government to relieve the three officers for central deputation Jaitley had said the Centre had overriding powers in the transfer of IPS officers The decision was taken in a meeting of the Union Cabinet and Attorney General Soli Sorabjee was asked to cut short a London trip to attend it\n\nJayalalithaa then like Mamata Banerjee now refused to spare those officers She wrote to other Chief Ministers for their support to protect the rights of the states She wrote about the disturbing trend in the management of the state cadres of All India Services and CentreState relations While declining the Centres demand she had said like Mamata said on Saturday that there was already a dearth of good officers in the state which needed those officers  Follow Express Explained on Telegram\n\nWhat the rules say\n\nFor the premier civil services  IAS IPS and Indian Forest Service  officers of the state cadre are allotted by the Centre from a pool of officers From time to time a certain number of officers are sent on central deputation The Home Ministry is the authority in control of IPS cadre the Department of Personnel and Training for the IAS cadre and the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change for IFS cadre\n\nMuthukaruppan told The Indian Express on Sunday I cannot comment on what the central government can do against the West Bengal officers but we approached CAT Central Administrative Tribunal which stayed the Home Ministry order None of us tried for central deputation since 2001 There was no other action by the central government against us\n\nThe Centre can take no action against civil service officials who are posted under the state government Rule 7 of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules 1969 states that the Authority to institute proceedings and to impose penalty will be the state government if the officer is serving in connection with the affairs of a State or is deputed for service under any company association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the Government of a State or in a local authority set up by an Act of the Legislature of that State For any action to be taken on an officer of the All India Services IAS IPS IFS the state and the Centre both need to agree\n\nRule 61 of the Indian Police Service Cadre Rules 1954 says about deputation in case of any disagreement the matter shall be decided by the central Government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the Central Government\n\nUnder the Home Ministrys deputation policy for IPS officers if an officer on offer is selected for a Central posting and does not report either on his own or at the instance of the State Government he would be debarred for consideration for a post under the Government of India for a period of five years Officers who have already been debarred should not be offered before the debarment period is over Being debarred from central deputation however hardly bothers an official if they prefer to work in their state\n\nAnother episode in February last year was a pointer to the Centres limitations in acting against All India Service officers The Home Ministry had written to then Chief Secretary Malay Kumar De calling for action against five officers including DGP Virendra for allegedly taking part in a dharna organised by the Trinamool Congress The state government however said no officer had taken part in the dharna\n\n The Indian Express is now on Telegram Click here to join our channel

		"Summary" : "Monitoring Desk\n\nFor generations familyrun farms in South India have grown and produced the natural dye that was once colonial capital\n\nIt is 6am in the small village of Kongarapattu in South India and the cloudy October sky is threatening to burst In the factory a foreman scuttles around anxiously checking for absent labourers two sariclad neighbours whisper to one another while combing their long hair and stray dogs run amok sensing the anticipation in the air\n\nFor four generations indigo has been grown harvested and made into dye on this familyowned plot in Tamil Nadu\n\nProduction which usually takes place three times a year was delayed this year because of the coronavirus pandemic But October finally brought the first day of thotti podurathu  when the traditional tanks are set up to extract the dye from the Indigofera plants\n\nBefore work can begin labourers and onlookers gather around the centuryold tanks for a simple pooja or prayer invoking divine blessings The foreman says a twominute prayer for Neel Atha or the Blue Mother  the sacred name the villagers have for indigo  and presents an offering of bananas and coconut blessed fruits according to Hindu rituals\n\nIt is almost a festival for our village says Balachander Anbhazhagan The 33yearold is the scion of KMA Exports an indigo farming and production company that has operated here since the 1960s\n\nBalachanders greatgrandfather started processing indigo during colonial times  when the naturally sourced dye was a valuable commodity\n\nThe Anbhazhagan family perfected the patient craft of extracting natural indigo dye from Indigofera plants using the same centuryold colonialera cement tanks their relatives used before them\n\nAll these years later the company is now the largest producer of natural indigo dye in India\n\nEven as a child I grew up with indigo all around me says the softspoken Balachander I have watched the indigo plants being harvested and have seen my grandmother offer her prayers to the Neel Atha before beginning indigo extraction at our plant\n\nHere indigo is perceived as a Blue Goddess In fact many Hindu Gods like Kaali and Krishna are often portrayed in the colour blue as it symbolises the colour of the cosmos\n\nWe envisage work as worship Balachander says\n\nGreen leaves to blue dye\n\nDuring colonial times many Indian farmers were strongarmed by the British Raj into growing indigo instead of food crops the dye was then bought by the Raj at unfairly low prices Today indigo is celebrated in Kongarappatu and neighbouring villages for putting them on the map a far cry from its wretched colonial past Every year export companies handicraft industries and renowned designers come knocking on the doors of this nondescript village to get their hands on the precious blue gold\n\nThe work of getting dye from Indigofera happens in stages First the leaves are harvested from neighbouring farms then they are gathered together and immersed in a huge tank filled with water where they are weighed down and allowed to ferment After the fermentation the leaves are removed and the water is drained into another massive tank where the solution oxidises and sediment settles at the bottom of the tank finally the sediment powder is dried and packed into cakes\n\nIndigofera plants which look a bit like basil must be harvested just before their pink flowers bloom Then the leaves have to reach the first tank within three hours in order to yield the best quality indigo Balachander says\n\nA fiveminute drive away from the extraction unit  past simple concrete village houses and a group of children playing cricket in a coconut grove  is an inconspicuous indigo farm where the leaves are ready for harvest Out in the fields the female farmers smile at the presence of strangers while the men seem to acknowledge the visitors less\n\nIn minutes sickles swinging deftly the men and women harvest the lush Indigofera plants that have grown about 10cm four inches high They then bundle up their bounty of leaves load it on a tractor and bring it to the tanks\n\nBack at the extraction unit one of the tanks is already full from the previous day wooden logs secured over the sea of leaves to keep the plants immersed in the water that shines with a greenishblue hue\n\nWith the pooja complete the foreman opens a hole in the upper tank and the water gushes into the tank below it After that to help the indigo particles settle as sediment at the bottom of the lower tank the water has to be aerated a process that used to be far more picturesque\n\nJust a few years back four labourers would stand in the tank and create turbulence in the water by kicking it for two hours says Balachander explaining the old process of aeration Now I had repurposed a machine used in aquaculture to mechanise this process\n\nFor 45 minutes the pedalling machine moves the water around kicking up a foamy layer In an hours time the greenish liquid turns into a brilliant blue The top slot of the tank is then opened up letting out water that will be used to irrigate nearby farms After 21 hours of sedimentation the bottom slot is opened to slowly release the remaining water in the tank together with a leftover powderlike substance This is then boiled in a brick kiln filtered and pressed and formed into small indigo cakes The cakes are dried for five days before they are ready to be used as dye\n\nAn ancient craft\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye 48yearold Pachaiyappan holds out his indigocoloured palms stained with the remains of another day spent turning Indigofera plants into blocks of dye\n\nFor five months every year for the last 20 years the farm labourer has travelled from the outskirts of Kongrapattu to the Anbhazhagans estate to do this work\n\nThis colour will remain in my hand for a week he says but till date this work has had no negative impact on my health as everything is natural\n\nPachaiyappan is so adept at the work that he can gauge when to stop the oxidation process by merely looking at the colour of the water He is also known for pressing the boiled indigo sediment into perfectlyshaped cakes\n\nAs a child I remember my father working in this very unit With no motor then he used to work on an etham  a traditional water irrigation device  to fill the tanks He used to sing a song while walking up and down a 20foot pole even as another helper filled the water in a pail which was then used to fill the tanks Now things arent complicated We dont even have to beat the water any more to oxidise it Pachaiyappan says\n\nBalachander says the manufacturing process has largely remained the same through the generations with the exception of some improved mechanisation to ease things for the labourers The most important thing for him is maintaining the original quality of the dye\n\nWe cant afford even a speck of dirt in our indigo cakes he reminds his team as they go about their work\n\nBalachander joined the family business in 2013 But it was not always part of his plan\n\nI did not plan on taking up my fathers business he tells Al Jazeera But while pursuing my MBA in the United States I had the opportunity of studying the supply chain management of our indigo production The more I read about indigos history and learned of its ecofriendly nature the more I was hooked\n\nIt came as a huge relief for his father farmerbusinessman M Anbhazhagan 63 who was eager to pass on the secrets of the craft to the next generation\n\nRemembering the day he himself joined the business in 1982 Anbhazhagan says My father had received only 10 cents 4356 square feet of land from my grandfather for indigo farming and he had just two tanks for indigo production an extraction tank where the harvested plants were seeped overnight and a sedimentation tank where the fermented water was oxidised manually by men by kicking the greenishblue water\n\nAnbhazhagan looks through pictures of his parents smiling behind a younger version of him and tells us that it is their blessings that helped him grow an indigo empire in his small village\n\nWhen he took over the business Anbhazhagan chose to sell directly to the artisans instead of selling it to agents This tripled our profits and by the early 90s we expanded it to four tanks  two for extraction and two for sedimentation Each tank could hold easily up to two tonnes of indigo plants and yields nearly 35kgs of indigo powder\n\nWhile the family now owns about 30 acres 12 hectares of land they also have contracts with other indigo farmers in hundreds of villages across Tamil Nadu allowing them to harvest more plants It amounts to nearly 2500 acres 1011 hectares in indigo production\n\nThe family is also proud of the fact that the work is sustainable\n\nThe best thing about this process is it is zero waste as the spent indigo leaves from the first tank are taken back to the fields for composting and the water from the second tank is used for irrigation Balachander says The older Anbhazhagan recalls that back in the day the leftover indigo leaves were the only fertiliser his father used for his other crops like millets or paddy It works as a great nitrogen fixer for the soil he explains\n\nIndigo has also helped the surrounding community Indigo is one of the main cash crops here and has helped farmers earn a decent living due to the thriving export dyeing business says Anbhazhagan I am happy that we have been able to provide work to at least 75 people in processing of indigo leaves\n\nWhere the blood is blue\n\nFinding a skilled and obliging workforce is not easy for all indigo producers Four kilometres 25 miles away from Kongrapattu farmer Mohammed Ayub 39 is trying to revive his familys legacy in indigo dye making in Vengandur in the coastal Villupuram district But he has encountered some roadblocks\n\nLocal women believe that Neel Amma another local term of endearment for indigo that translates to Blue Mother doesnt like women working in the tanks he says With most men migrating out of our villages to find work in cities its been very tough to find skilled labourers to make indigo dye\n\nAyub is a man of few words and it takes a while for the farmerproducer to open up about his familys journey with the mystical indigo His great grandfather worked in the court of Tipu Sultan  an 18thcentury ruler of Mysore from the neighbouring state of Karnataka he says After Tippu Sultans death in 1799 Ayubs family relocated to Vellore district and then settled in Vengandur in the 1830s\n\nAs indigo was in high demand at that time my great grandfather Janab Mohideen Basha took up the cultivation of Indigofera Tinctoria a plant known to produce a good quality indigo dye In fact records show that England alone imported 40000 tonnes of Indigo from India in 1895\n\nThe coronavirus also caused Ayub to temporarily shut down his indigo operations but he agrees to give a tour of the estate Right in the middle of a busy highway a large dilapidated wall welcomes us Behind it are four huge tanks largely overrun with wild shrubs and plants Despite the vehicles whizzing by there is hardly any human presence around At a distance a shepherd can be seen reigning in his bleating sheep\n\nAyub explains that he last ran the tank in January before the lockdowns commenced For the visitor it feels like being in a time capsule The pleasant indigo fields guarded by tall coconut trees provide a perfect backdrop to the 1515foot 4545metre indigo tanks\n\nFor two centuries these cascading tanks have magically transformed lush green indigo leaves into the deepest shades of blue dye Behind it is a 12foothigh 37metrehigh colonial brick kiln which is still used to boil the indigo mixture A little further on the right the gleaming water in a 36footdeep 11metredeep ancient well that has stood for generations is a reminder of all that indigo has survived  from world wars to revolts to chemical dyes to the current coronavirus crisis\n\nOf colonial oppression and revolution\n\nIndigo also known as the King of Dyes is one of the worlds most ancient dyes It has been used by the people of Egypt and Asia for more than 4000 years Even a 12thcentury Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about indigo a product of India being a slime that adheres to the scum upon reeds When it is sifted out it is black but in dilution it yields a marvellous mixture of purple and blue \n\nEven until the 19th century when synthetic indigo was discovered the Indigofera plant was the only known source to achieve longlasting blue Though several countries in East Asia produced indigo India remained a major source for the world In the late 1500s French and Norwegian officials even banned the Indian indigo calling it the devils dye to protect the production of their native woadbased blue dye For the East India Company and later the British Raj indigo turned out to be one of the most profitable commodities\n\nTushar Gandhi Mahatma Gandhis greatgrandson talks about how this blue gold led to one of the most defining moments of Indian independence\n\nIndigo was a very precious dying source for textileproducing mills of England When it was discovered that it grew well in certain North Indian states  like Bengal and Bihar  they utilised the zamindar or landowner and landlord system to force the cultivation of indigo instead of food crops he tells Al Jazeera via telephone\n\nIn mid19th century Bengal these farmers were provided loans with such extremely high interest rates that it would pass on to the next generations forcing descendants to become bonded indigo labourers The selling price disparity was also so high that the farmers were only given 25 percent of what the indigo would fetch on a global market he explains\n\nIn 1859 the distraught Bengal farmers led a revolt that practically brought indigo production to its knees Following the revolt a commission was set to study the state of indigo peasants The Indigo Commission report had then observed not a chest of Indigo reached England without being stained with human blood\n\nIt was in Bengals first uprising against indigo dictatorship that farmers took oppressors to court and won a landmark judgement in their favour Tushar Gandhi says Years later Bihar farmers reeled under the oppressive teenkathia system where indigo had to be mandatorily grown in 320th of a farmland With discovery of chemical dye by Germany in 1878 the indigo market collapsed and the farmers situation in Bihar became even more deplorablehttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nIn 1917 when Mahatma Gandhi visited Champaran to meet and document the issues of the indigo farmers it led to his first nonviolent Satyagraha movement march for truth\n\nI believe Gandhi based his strategy on Bengals precedence to demand legal justice At that time the greatest oppression was against the agrarian community There were agrarian revolts in many places and even though they were dispersed they became a formidable force to deal with Tushar Gandhi adds Babu was shrewd enough to identify this segment and other impoverished craftsmen who were left unemployed by the industrial revolution he used their unity to fight the battles for Indian Independence\n\nFaithful farmers\n\nWhile wars and revolts shook the indigo market Ayubs family has been faithfully growing indigo together with other crops like sugarcane and groundnut for four generations since the 1830s\n\nOne reason could be indigo is a lowcost crop There is no need for any external fertiliser and you can get a yield every three months Ayub suggests But his uncle Niyaz Ahamed feels the crops are more about preserving their familys legacy\n\nWhile Ayub had left his career in the hospitality industry to return to farming in his village in 2016 Ahamed had in fact relocated from the village to the capital city Chennai in 2000 to secure a better education for his children Yet the mysterious blue refuses to let go of him he says Even in a city like Chennai while pursuing another business we are trying to produce indigo dyes in plastic drums It is a part of who we are says Ahamed with a hint of pride in his voice\n\nAlthough colonial indigo farming met much resistance in North India Ahamed says that his father Dada Miyan Sahib Ayubs paternal grandfather was always able to do business on his own terms  whether with British or French traders or later with the Indian railways department\n\nEven when we did not sow indigo we would still rent out the tank for indigo production to private companies My fathers only condition would be that they store the indigo dye in our house so that he can check and ensure the quality of the indigo before it is sold says Ahamed\n\nI still remember my father sneaking out indigo dye to Pondicherry a French colony at that time and whose border was closely monitored by the British Raj in India and while coming back he would bring us Chinese silk or a bottle of sugar mixed with water to avoid detection If caught he would have been arrested by the Raj\n\nAs for Vengandur indigo still plays an intrinsic role in the lives of people who live there\n\nWhenever a child is born in our village the cloth used for filtering the indigo dye is taken to swaddle the baby as it has medicinal properties Older children with ailments like fever are also made to sleep on a piece of indigodyed cloth for faster recovery We have also been regularly supplying indigo roots avari in local parlance to traditional healers who use it for various skin ailments and allergies And of course other farmers use our spent indigo sheaves as fertiliser for their fields says Ahamed\n\nThe art of natural dyeing\n\nIn Auroville an hours drive from Kongarapattu Jesus Ciriza Larraona is the founder of a natural dyeing research unit called The Colours of Nature For more than 25 years he has been perfecting the art of indigo dyeing learning from ancient texts and traditional craftsmen from across India and the world\n\nAt his premises a group of masked women sit embroidering at a corner table with their heads bowed in concentration Meanwhile other men and women twist and twirl sections of cotton yarn as they wash them clean two women dipping it in alum  a mordant used to set colours on fabric  while another dries a fresh batch of the yarn\n\nLarraona takes us to his sanctum sanctorum  a large shed where his indigo vats are kept A pungent smell fills the air amidst rows and rows of basket lids interspersing those rows are indigodripping cloth filters which hang from the top of the shed like bats in a belfry\n\nThere are 60 pots with 1000 litre capacity each Larraona says as he removes a basket lid to reveal the vat below that is used to dye raw materials indigo\n\nThe indigo in the vat sports a greenish hue with a blue foam bubbling around it Kumar one of Larraonas master craftsmen slowly immerses the white yarn in the vat and rotates After minutes of working the yarn emerges as a dark shade of green Another helper dries it out and in a matter of seconds the green transforms into the magical indigohttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nThe soluble indigo in the vat impregnates the white cloth When taken out it oxidises and becomes blue The processing time varies based on the shade of indigo one needs Larraona explains He sources his indigo cakes from farmerproducer Anbhazhagan in Kongarappatu\n\nLarraona is originally from Spain When asked how he ended up dyeing indigo in India he laughs In 1992 I was on my second visit to India when a friend in Barcelona had requested me to source a carpet to play chess So I went to Srinagar to find out more about the beautiful Kashmiri carpets The friendly locals had given me a shikara houseboat to discover the city on my own It was while exploring the pristine lakes I saw how the chemical dyeing of carpets was polluting the water bodies It disturbed me he says\n\nAs luck would have it he stumbled upon a colony that worked with natural dyes while looking for artisans to make chess figurines So when I decided to settle down in the international community of Auroville I chose to work on the art of natural dyeing and thus The Colours of Nature was born in 1993 But the journey was not easy\n\nI found an elaborative book on natural dyes from the 1890s and started to reproduce indigo But it was not working It was Mr Anbhazhagan who guided me to a Guledgudda in Karnataka a village renowned for Ilkal saris a traditional sari with cotton body and silk border The Hasilcar family there had dyed indigo for generations Two of the members agreed to come and teach me indigo dyeing in Auroville We started with four pots they knew all the techniques but the fermentation still wasnt right I then realised the Hasilcars had switched to synthetic indigo two decades ago hence couldnt remember the smell of the dye and were not able to handle the pot\n\nIt was after interacting with various dyeing experts from Japan Thailand and Mexico and reading several books that he was able to understand and revive the natural indigo fermentation process In fact he held a workshop to teach it back to the Hasilcars\n\nHe says that he continues to experiment to find more ecofriendly ways to dye and has not replaced the water in his vats for more than 24 years He now has plans to reuse the sediment in the vat as a fixing agent for other colours too  including yellow Marigold flower and red Rubia cordifolia\n\nThe synthetic challenge\n\nFor all the efforts Larraona has taken to preserve and revive the art of natural dyeing his toughest challenge has been dealing with synthetic colours that claim to be natural indigo in the market\n\nJagadda Rajappa an expert on natural dyeing and fabrics agrees that it is very hard to find unadulterated indigo in the Indian market The cost of the German synthetic indigo 300400 rupees per kilogramme  45kg is much lesser than natural indigo 3000 rupeeskg  41kg The reduction process is the same and it is very difficult for a buyer to find out if the dye used is natural or not\n\nAyub shares an insider tip saying natural indigo cakes normally float in water while chemical ones do not\n\nWhile Balachander tells us export companies do run tests for authenticity Rajappa opines that the Indian market is not as discerning towards natural dyes and hardly differentiates between the two But the new breed of green designers hopes to bring back the glory days of natural indigo in India\n\nYou will always find a block of natural indigo in my office claims Delhibased designer Rahul Mishra who is known for ecofriendly ensembles that highlight handmade fabrics and natural dyes He vaguely recalls his first experience with indigohttps58e3f13ea33554194b64b435853b7881safeframegooglesyndicationcomsafeframe1037htmlcontainerhtml\n\nAs a child I remember seeing a huge building called Neel Kothi or blue house in my native village Malhausi Neel Kothis were indigo factories of the British era My grandmother revealed that almost everyone in the village grew indigo at some point of time Inspired by Gandhiji even my grandmother used to spin her own cotton and got it woven by a local weaver before indigo dyeing it herself\n\nThough Mahatma Gandhi fought against the indiscriminate practices of indigo planters he lent his support to Indias native dyeing techniques and wrote a book on it Vanaspatiyon Nu Rang Handspun fabrics and natural dyes were seen as symbols of selfreliance during Indias independence movement Currently with the fashion industry turning to be the second major polluting industry in the world Mishra believes that it is the right time to rediscover natural dyes like indigo to move towards a more sustainable future\n\nFrom the past to the future\n\nThanks to the unrelenting efforts of experts like Larraona or Rajappa the ancient art of indigo dyeing is not lost to the next generation Rajappas own experimentation with natural dyes began with simple kitchen staples like turmeric and beets After years of dabbling with natural dyes she met her guru in Yellapa who belonged to a family of traditional indigo dyers from Anantapur district in the state of Andhra Pradesh 400km from Kongarappattu It took her five years of coaxing to persuade the master craftsman to teach her his trade When he agreed she chose not to just to watch him work she wanted to be drenched in the deep indigo rituals\n\nYellapa had about 100 vats and Rajappa went about learning every nuance  from burying the pots in packed earth to stabilise the temperature to feeding the vat with cassia tora seeds to speed up the fermentation process to refilling the indigo dyes\n\nWe need to treat the vat like a living organism it would take all of our senses to know when it is perfect From smell touch to even stirring sound one can perfect the art of indigo dyeing only with time Even if a vat goes wrong an artisan would know ways to fix it With patience you will be able to watch a vat transform nothingness into abundance she says And that experience is precisely what she wants to share with anyone willing to give in to the spirit of Indigo\n\nHaving conducted various natural dyeing workshops Rajappa says it is heartening to see the revival of indigo farming and dyeing in various pockets of India  from Puducherry to Vijayawada Rajasthan to Bengal\n\nShe believes it is the right time to relook at the indigenous knowledge of natural dyeing and use local ingredients to create sustainable dyes\n\nNature will never tire of surprising us with her colours she says"

		"Title" : "To reduce India’s vaccine hesitancy around Covid-19, Modi needs to “let doctors do the talking”",
		"PublishDate" : "2020-12-14 06:26:00.000000",
		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "Uddipana Goswami a 27yearold Hyderabadbased corporate professional is not quite holding her breath for a Covid19 vaccine I trust our scientists and their work but not politically driven statements said Goswami\n\nGoswami cited prime minister Narendra Modis address to opposition leaders at an allparty meeting in the first week of December where he said the vaccine would be available in India within weeks\n\nTill the other day there was no vaccine but suddenly after Britain Mr Prime Minister announces that within weeks a vaccine will come she said I am not a fool\n\nThen she pointed out offensive statements that the Bharatiya Janata Party which is in power at the Centre had made over the last couple of months She was referring to the party promising free vaccines if voted to power during the Bihar Assembly and Hyderabad civil polls campaigns It is a shame that a humanitarian crisis has been turned into a political agenda she said\n\nNo vaccination rush\n\nGoswamis apprehensions may have to do more with her politics but her hesitancy to get inoculated against Covid19 may be more common than one might imagine In an online survey carried out by LocalCircles a community social media platform which received over 25000 responses from 262 districts nearly 60 said they would not rush to take a vaccine even if it was available by February\n\nConsidering the pandemic has completely upended peoples lives for almost a yearand vaccines are being projected as the only possible way to halt the viruss chargethe results of the survey would perhaps appear to be somewhat counterintuitive notwithstanding the usual caveats of online surveys\n\nSafe and effective\n\nVaccine hesitancy is complex and driven by several factors\n\nBut experts warn against drawing simplistic connections Vaccine hesitancyloosely defined as the phenomenon of people refusing to get inoculated despite the presence of a safe and effective vaccineis complex and driven by several factors\n\nAlso the idea of safe and effective itself could be sometimes contested as conversations around Covid19 vaccines illustrate Many have raised questions on whether a vaccine developed within monthsvaccine trials usually stretch over several yearscan be deemed safe even if governments and corporations say so There is no way to know for sure that a vaccine is completely safe or effective with such a short period of testing over such few people said Prabir Chatterjee a doctor in rural Bengal\n\nChatterjee who has been part of Indias national polio surveillance project in various capacities said I am not saying the Pfizer vaccine which has been said to be safe and effective is not good because I do not know But anyone who tells you it has no problems is also lying There is simply no way to know so soonit will take a year at least\n\nSandhya Srinivasan a Mumbaibased public health researcher and journalist said to wait and watch as a section of people seems to be doing might be a very rational approach in the context of the Covid19 vaccine It made sense she said to weigh the possible risks of a new vaccine against ones own perceived risk of serious illness\n\nThe trust factor\n\nBut the seeming reluctance among Indians visàvis the Covid19 vaccine researchers say may extend beyond concerns about its science In other words there could be others like Goswami who may not doubt the science of the vaccines as much as the politics driving their availability\n\nTrust after all plays a key role in shaping public opinion towards vaccines explained Vijayprasad Gopichandran a community medicine physician from Chennai Indias Covid19 story so far on the other hand has been marred by episodes that did not inspire public confidence which Gopichandran said could have led to vaccine hesitancy\n\nHe referred to the serious adverse event reported in one of the vaccine trialswhich many alleged was mishandled and betrayed a lack of transparency on the part of the Indian authorities Then the BJPs promise to deliver free vaccines in Bihar if voted to power could have led to distrust in vaccination policy said Gopichandran Then of course more generally the health systems handling of the pandemic itself All these have contributed to the vaccine hesitancy said Gopichandran\n\nChatterjee too spoke of a trust deficit that he believed the current dispensation suffered from Unfortunately this government does not always tell the truth he said So even if it is pushing a good vaccine there will be some lies And since there is the social media and multiple news outlets these days the lies will get caught and depending on spin the news story is given one or the other community will get provoked and refuse to get vaccinated There is after all no dearth of groups or communities government has antagonised\n\nLet doctors do the talking\n\nThus it was absolutely imperative Chatterjee said that the vaccination approval process left no room for suspicion and experts communicated openly and clearly That has not happened so far according to Chatterjee\n\nA lot of doctors are already pissed off with the government for various reasons This is only going to make it worse\n\nHe said Why is the prime minister pushing it Let doctors do the talking We know he doesnt know about vaccines A lot of doctors are already pissed off with the government for various reasons This is only going to make it worse\n\nChatterjee who has spent long years working in the governments pulse polio and other routine immunisation programmes in east India drew on his own experiences When parents showed reluctance to let their children take the polio drops I would often take it in front of them to convince them it was safe he said And it worked I could do that because I was absolutely sure about its safety Maybe it was not effective as it was projected to be but it was 100 safe But let me tell you I am not going to take the Covid vaccine anytime soon\n\nIf doctors were unconvinced about a vaccine Chatterjee said immunisation programmes were hard to implement In Burdwan I remember it was the doctors who fought against the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine they refused to give it he said So we could not give it there\n\nVaccine hesitancy in India\n\nHistorically Indian policymakers have enthusiastic backers of the idea of vaccination as an idea Independent India s immunisation record the historian Niels Brimnes writes in his book The Politics of Vaccination A Global History is largely one of acceptance and implementation of the international agenda set by WHO or the World Health Organisation\n\nAccording to Brimes the majority of Indians accepted immunisation Reluctance whenever it happened Brimes writes was often due to indifference or vague fears about imperfectly understood practices and organised ideological or political opposition was rare\n\nYet some of Indias most influential politicians had strong reservations about vaccination There was of course Mohandas Gandhi who was opposed to the idea of vaccination Gandhis contention was that sanitation was a more useful and morally acceptable alternative\n\nC Rajagopalachari whom Gandhi had once described as a conscience keeper strongly opposed the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis Rajagopalachari was not convinced about the safety of the vaccinebut there was more to his opposition An ardent nationalist Rajagopalachari believed that Indians were being used as research subjects for the sake of Western science\n\nAnother wellknown vaccine sceptic in modern India was Debabar Banerji an academic Banerji wasnt antivaccination as such but thought of it as a topdown quick fix that skirted Indias public health problems He had a postcolonial critique too he believed the West was imposing vaccination on developing countries as penance for its year of plundering as a colonial force without taking the pain to invest in making structural investment in health infrastructures\n\nApart from these wellarticulated strands of opposition there have been many instances of vaccine hesitancy at the community level driven by a variety of factors such as media misinformation and political insecurities Fears of impotency seen most recently among Muslim communities in the states of Haryana Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Assam also been a major driver of hesitancy\n\nThe politics of resistance\n\nResearchers and doctors however say no one demography or geography is more prone to antivaccination tendencies I first encountered fears of impotency in relation to the polio vaccine among the Rajput community in 2000 in Banka district said Chatterjee And it was only after that it shifted to the Muslims\n\nPeople had started to believe the health department was only for family planning\n\nGopichandran said a lot of welleducated proscience rational people have become aware and are raising questions about vaccines The MR measlesrubella vaccine met with major hesitancy in welleducated pockets of Tamil Nadu and Kerala he said\n\nRegardless of the source of hesitancy it is important to address them say experts People who raise reasonable doubts about vaccines are labelled antivaxxers which is a way of shutting down any criticism of specific vaccines and how they are administered and funding agencies and government policies that include unnecessary inappropriate or unsafe vaccines said Srinivasan\n\nFor instance Srinivasan pointed out marginalised communities may resist because they feel that health workers approach them only for contraceptionsterilisation related programmes\n\nIndeed as several research studies have revealed minority communities in Uttar Pradesh resisted the polio vaccination drive because they felt the state was insensitive to their other health needs The sterilisation rumours only were only the immediate trigger Fears of sterilisation were real as for years people had family planning shoved down their throats said Chatterjee Thats why those rumours of impotency because people had started to believe the health department was only for family planning\n\nAs sociologist Harish Naraindas who has studied vaccination in India put it Rumours may be an allegory or a moral commentary if you wish on both state and society\n\nBesides observers say that lack of robust redressal mechanisms to deal with possible vaccinerelated adverse events could also drive hesitancy The state may not have legal provisions in place to address vaccinerelated morbidity including sick leave job loss etc arising from its short or long term consequences pointed out Naraindas\n\nThen there was the oftenoverlooked matter of consent In 2018 the Delhi governments campaign to administer the measlesrubella vaccine to students at school ran into trouble after parents complained that their consent had not been sought Thus vaccine hesitancy Srinivasan explained had a lot to do with how people are approached and how information is shared and consent is asked for and taken\n\nVaccine hesitancy Chatterjee said could be dealt withbut it required policymakers to be deft and gentle Its all about taking time to understand who is hesitating why they are hesitating so that you can strategise how to win them over he said\n\nThis reporting was supported by a grant from the Thakur Family Foundation Thakur Family

BJP will get a face it badly needs especially in rural Bengal reports Aditi Phadnis\n\nIMAGE Suvendu Adhikari resigned as the West Bengal minister for transport irrigation and waterways in November setting off speculation that he will join the BJP Photograph Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances NDPS Act is one reason why the Trinamool Congress MLA from Nandigram Suvendu Adhikari would resign from the party and his seat in the West Bengal assembly to probably join the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP\n\nThere are many others\n\nHe had the option of forming a party after he fell out of favour with TMC chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee but the NDPS Act is the favoured weapon of choice of the West Bengal government against political opponents\n\nAnd Adhikari fears thousands of his supporters could be thrown into jail by the state government if he did not have the central governments protection\n\nWith his exit the TMC will lose a crucial politically influential vote catcher in the Jangalmahal region and areas in minoritydominated Murshidabad and the BJP will get a face it badly needs especially in rural Bengal\n\nHow Suvendu Adhikari became the goto man in the politics of south Bengal is well documented\n\nHis father Sisir Adhikari a Congressman was a force to reckon with and was a minister in the Manmohan Singh government\n\nIn a region dominated by the Left Contai and Tamluk flew the Congress flag defiantly\n\nAs the Left empire crumbled Nandigram hastened its collapse and it was Suvendu Adhikari who led the protest against the Lefts land grabbing\n\nRecognising his potential Mamata made him president of the TMC youth wing and the partys observer for Jangalmahal at the time in the grips of Maoist groups\n\nIn a space of fewer than five years the TMC was able to gouge political space from both the Congress and the Left as well as regain the trust of young men in the region who were drifting into Leftwing extremism\n\nHis rise was impressive In 2009 Suvendu was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tamluk defeating Communist Party of IndiaMarxist strongman Lakshman Seth by 172000 votes\n\nHe retained the Tamluk parliamentary constituency by defeating the CPIMs Ibrahim Ali in 2014\n\nIn 2016 the TMC fielded him in the assembly election from Nandigram\n\nHe was pitted against Abdul Kadir Sheikh joint candidate of the Left Front and the Congress\n\nSuvendu won the contest getting over 67 per cent votes\n\nAfter his spectacular win Mamata made him minister of transport In 2018 he was also given the charge of environment\n\nBut Mamata was getting wary of his rise Besides she had her own succession plan and it did not involve Suvendu\n\nBut she could not ignore his proven political work either so a parallel organisation TMC Juba was created and her nephew Abhishek was chosen to head it\n\nLater she dissolved the TMC Juba and the TMCs youth wing was resurrected Once again under Abhishek\n\nSuvendu was used to grow the party  but he was never allowed into Mamatas inner circle\n\nNor did he particularly want to be counted as a courtier As an MLA he made it a point never to spend the night in Kolkata He would drive 200 km every day from his constituency to the state capital sometimes reaching home at 1 am and leaving early morning again to go to work\n\nThe trust deficit between the CM and her most important minister was evident\n\nHe once observed I was transport minister but Mamata ran the ministry\n\nJuly 21 every year is remembered in Nandigram as martyrs day\n\nInitially the TMC observed this with great fanfare But now the ritual of remembering those who died defending their land in firing ordered by the Left Front has fallen into disuse Except Suvendu who still follows it scrupulously\n\nThis year it was observed online\n\nOn July 23 the TMC held its core committee meeting There Mamata announced all observers posts now stood abolished\n\nThis affected Suvendu the most it signalled his work in the Jangalmahal was over and he must stay confined to his constituency\n\nOther slights followed\n\nA cyclone hit Bengal earlier this year East Midnapore was badly hit but rehabilitation was the slowest there and the focus was in South 24 Parganas\n\nAfter Covid19 spread in Bengal the CM interacted and drew up plans with every minister except Suvendu\n\nAfter Durga Puja it seemed the differences were irreconcilable Posters came up all over Suvendus constituency at programmes he sponsored They said Dadar anugami follower of Dada\n\nOfficially Suvendu denied all knowledge But there were no TMC banner or picture of Mamata at these meetings\n\nIn the meantime sensing he was on the brink TMC leaders travelled to Nandigram and held a meeting wher e he was dubbed Mir Jaffer\n\nEfforts are now on at reconciliation But Suvendu will not be able to accept the leadership of Abhishek which is what it all boils down to\n\nHis defection to the BJP could be a gamechanger in Bengal politics"

		"Summary" : "December 14 2020 1316 IST\n\nWith his exit the TMC will lose a crucial politically influential vote catcher in the Jungalmahal region and areas in minoritydominated Murshidabad and the BJP will get a face it badly needs especially in rural Bengal reports Aditi Phadnis\n\nIMAGE Suvendu Adhikari resigned as the West Bengal minister for transport irrigation and waterways in November setting off speculation that he will join the BJP Photograph Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances NDPS Act is one reason why the Trinamool Congress MLA from Nandigram Suvendu Adhikari would resign from the party and his seat in the West Bengal assembly to probably join the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP\n\nThere are many others\n\nHe had the option of forming a party after he fell out of favour with TMC chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee but the NDPS Act is the favoured weapon of choice of the West Bengal government against political opponents\n\nAnd Adhikari fears thousands of his supporters could be thrown into jail by the state government if he did not have the central governments protection\n\nWith his exit the TMC will lose a crucial politically influential vote catcher in the Jangalmahal region and areas in minoritydominated Murshidabad and the BJP will get a face it badly needs especially in rural Bengal\n\nHow Suvendu Adhikari became the goto man in the politics of south Bengal is well documented\n\nHis father Sisir Adhikari a Congressman was a force to reckon with and was a minister in the Manmohan Singh government\n\nIn a region dominated by the Left Contai and Tamluk flew the Congress flag defiantly\n\nAs the Left empire crumbled Nandigram hastened its collapse and it was Suvendu Adhikari who led the protest against the Lefts land grabbing\n\nRecognising his potential Mamata made him president of the TMC youth wing and the partys observer for Jangalmahal at the time in the grips of Maoist groups\n\nIn a space of fewer than five years the TMC was able to gouge political space from both the Congress and the Left as well as regain the trust of young men in the region who were drifting into Leftwing extremism\n\nHis rise was impressive In 2009 Suvendu was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tamluk defeating Communist Party of IndiaMarxist strongman Lakshman Seth by 172000 votes\n\nHe retained the Tamluk parliamentary constituency by defeating the CPIMs Ibrahim Ali in 2014\n\nIn 2016 the TMC fielded him in the assembly election from Nandigram\n\nHe was pitted against Abdul Kadir Sheikh joint candidate of the Left Front and the Congress\n\nSuvendu won the contest getting over 67 per cent votes\n\nAfter his spectacular win Mamata made him minister of transport In 2018 he was also given the charge of environment\n\nBut Mamata was getting wary of his rise Besides she had her own succession plan and it did not involve Suvendu\n\nBut she could not ignore his proven political work either so a parallel organisation TMC Juba was created and her nephew Abhishek was chosen to head it\n\nLater she dissolved the TMC Juba and the TMCs youth wing was resurrected Once again under Abhishek\n\nSuvendu was used to grow the party  but he was never allowed into Mamatas inner circle\n\nNor did he particularly want to be counted as a courtier As an MLA he made it a point never to spend the night in Kolkata He would drive 200 km every day from his constituency to the state capital sometimes reaching home at 1 am and leaving early morning again to go to work\n\nThe trust deficit between the CM and her most important minister was evident\n\nHe once observed I was transport minister but Mamata ran the ministry\n\nJuly 21 every year is remembered in Nandigram as martyrs day\n\nInitially the TMC observed this with great fanfare But now the ritual of remembering those who died defending their land in firing ordered by the Left Front has fallen into disuse Except Suvendu who still follows it scrupulously\n\nThis year it was observed online\n\nOn July 23 the TMC held its core committee meeting There Mamata announced all observers posts now stood abolished\n\nThis affected Suvendu the most it signalled his work in the Jangalmahal was over and he must stay confined to his constituency\n\nOther slights followed\n\nA cyclone hit Bengal earlier this year East Midnapore was badly hit but rehabilitation was the slowest there and the focus was in South 24 Parganas\n\nAfter Covid19 spread in Bengal the CM interacted and drew up plans with every minister except Suvendu\n\nAfter Durga Puja it seemed the differences were irreconcilable Posters came up all over Suvendus constituency at programmes he sponsored They said Dadar anugami follower of Dada\n\nOfficially Suvendu denied all knowledge But there were no TMC banner or picture of Mamata at these meetings\n\nIn the meantime sensing he was on the brink TMC leaders travelled to Nandigram and held a meeting wher e he was dubbed Mir Jaffer\n\nEfforts are now on at reconciliation But Suvendu will not be able to accept the leadership of Abhishek which is what it all boils down to\n\nHis defection to the BJP could be a gamechanger in Bengal politics"

		"Summary" : "The covid19 pandemic has shown we as a country need a lot to improve For any government caring for the people of the country is the first job The poor and needy must be at the top of the priority list to ensure they have enough to survive a situation like Covid19 In the last few months migrant workers took a significant hit due to the lockdown followed by a substantial dip in the economy However the Government pulled up the sleeves at the right time and announced several packages to ensure relief for these workers\n\nAs per reports only 10 of the allocated funds for the Rural Development ministry under the MGNREGS scheme remain with 4 months to go for the end of the current financial year\n\nRecord high fund allocation and wage payments\n\nWhen the workers moved back to their native places the first thing that they needed was work This is where MGNREGS came into action The union government has allocated approximately Rs85000 crore for employment under the scheme out of which Rs77000 crores have already been spent Over Rs55000 crore were paid in the form of wages while the rest of the funds went to other costs including material and skilled wages over Rs19000 crore administration costs over Rs2400 crore and so on As per the reports generated by the Ministry of Rural Development of the Government of India 9815 of payments were made within 15 days which is much better compared to the previous years\n\nAs per stats provided by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nGuaranteed employment under MGNREGA\n\nPassed in 2005 the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MGNREGA mandates the provision of at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work The main objectives of the Act include a minimum of 100 days of unskilled manual work as guaranteed employment in a financial year ensuring social including strengthening the livelihood of poor and strengthening Panchayati Raj institutions The Act helps in rejuvenating the natural resource base of rural areas and creates a durable and productive rural asset base\n\nThe surge in employment demand under MGNREGA during Covid19 pandemic\n\nDuring the Covid19 pandemic the lockdown loss of employment migration of workers back to native states and other factors created a surge in employment demand under the MGNREGS A total of 1465 crore job cards were issued in the current financial year out of which 1406 crore workers are still active 1905 are among active workers from SC communities and 1579 active workers from ST communities\n\nOut of 1406 crore active workers 1905 are SC and 1579 are ST Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nSurge in persondays generated compared to previous years\n\nAs per the ministrys data so far 277 crore persondays have been generated under the scheme compared to 26562 crore persondays in the last financial year Since 201617 this financial year has generated the most persondays with over three months to go There are some sections where this year lacked as well In the financial year 202021 the percentage of women persondays created went down by approx 2 compared to the previous year\n\nPersondays generated this year has surpassed previous years numbers with 3 months to go Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nThere has been a sharp decline in the total number of households that have completed 100 days of wage employment In this yes over 2097000 households have completed the target compared to over 40 lakh households in the previous year and 52 lakh households in the year before However the inclusion of differentlyabled persons was much better this year with over 530000 workers included compared to over 463000 last year According to a nongovernment group of NGOs named People Action for Employment Guarantees NREGA tracker states like Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have to dip into their own funds to ensure timely payments to the workers The lowest number of households getting 100 days of employment was lowest in Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand\n\nAreas where the stats show decline compared to previous years Data by Ministry of Rural Development\n\nHindustan Times quoted Jharkhands rural development secretary Aradhana Patnaik as saying We have been stagnating at around 70 million persondays for the past three years But we have achieved 777 million persondays against the target of 80 million\n\nMore funds will be allocated when required\n\nOne of the major concerns that these stats depict is the lack of funds under MGNREGA for over three months left in the financial year The Government has ensured that more funds will be allocated for the scheme whenever required and the states will get their share on time As of now around 94 of funds are available out of the allocated funds The demand for employment under the scheme is decreasing slowly as the workers are returning to the cities\n\nHowever the government aims to provide them with employment at their native places to ensure they do not have to migrate for work There are several schemes such as Gareeb Kalyal Rojgar Abhiyan under which the state and union government is generating jobs for unskilled and skilled workers Under these schemes the government is also providing training to the workers to upscale their income in the coming months"

even as thousands of others intensified their nationwide pushback against the legislations reported ANI\n\nThe delegation comprising farmers from Uttar Pradesh Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Bihar and Haryana were associated with the All India Kisan Coordination Committee\n\nIn a memorandum submitted to Tomar the group claimed that some elements of the farmers community especially in Delhi were trying to create misunderstandings about the new reforms which propose to overhaul the way farmers do business in the country\n\nThe dawn of freedom that is visible after our untiring efforts and long struggle some elements are trying to create misunderstanding among farmers to turn it into dark night the memorandum stated To fulfil our responsibility towards crores of farmers of the country we have come from different parts of the country to meet you We have come here to show that farmers from different parts of the country are supporting these laws\n\nThe group said it has been an unhappy victim of the old market system We do not want that the same system of exploitation is imposed on farmers under any condition it said\n\nThe new farm laws among other things allows farmers to sell outside mandis notified by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee essentially eliminating agents who act as middlemen between the farmers and the governmentregulated wholesale markets A majority of farmers protesting against the legislations are against this as they feel these agents are essential to the agricultural economy and are their main source of credit\n\nThe memorandum urged the Narendra Modi government not to withdraw the three laws under the pressure of farmers agitation in some parts of the country Because if it happens farmers from different parts of the country will be bound to come on the streets for their rights it said\n\nThe group of organisations also recommended that the government should spread awareness about farm laws through public campaigns and should focus on introducing newage technology in the agriculture sector\n\nMembers of All India Kisan Coordination Committee had come from Tamil Nadu Telangana Maharashtra Bihar They supported Farm Bills and gave us a letter on the same They said that the Modi govt has done this for the welfare of farmers  they welcome  support it Agri Minister pictwittercomLE5xX9xKsd  ANI ANI December 14 2020\n\nUnion

for the welfare of farmers and they welcome and support it he said\n\nAsked about the meeting with the leaders of protesting farmers Tomar said the government is unconditionally ready to negotiate with them\n\nWe have said that we are ready for the talks he added The government will definitely do it if their farmer unions proposal comesWe want the discussions to be held clause by clause They will give their opinion on our proposal we will definitely hold further talks\n\nOn December 9 the leaders of farmer unions had rejected the Centres written proposal on the amendments to the three laws saying they would accept nothing short of a complete rollback of the policies\n\nWe have said that we are ready for the talks Govt will definitely do it if their farmer unions proposal comesWe want the discussions to be held clause by clause Theyll give their opinion on our proposal well definitely hold further talks Agriculture Minister NS Tomar pictwittercomMJugQyzwi3  ANI ANI December 14 2020\n\nThe meeting between the farmers supporting the legislations and Tomar came on the day when thousands of farmers who have been camping in the outskirts of Delhi went on a daylong hunger strike to mark their discontent\n\nTens of thousands of farmers mostly from Punjab and Haryana have hunkered down at key entry points to Delhi for 19 days saying they wont leave till the government abolishes what they call the black laws The farmers fear the agricultural reforms will weaken the minimum support price mechanism under which the government buys agricultural produce will lead to the deregulation of croppricing deny them fair remuneration for their produce and leave them at the mercy of corporations\n\nHowever internal conflicts have emerged It started on December 8 when representatives of three groups which claimed to cumulatively represent 120000 farmers of Haryana accepted the newly passed agricultural laws provided certain sections of the legislations to be amended  something the government has said it was willing to do\n\nOn Sunday a delegation of more than 100 farmers from Uttarakhand had also extended their support to the laws reported the Hindustan Times Last week farmers representing Har Kisan an organisation of 116 farmerowned agricultural enterprises known as farmer producer organisations too told the agriculture minister that they want the laws to remain in force\n\nFollow todays live updates of the farmers protest here"

		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "In July 2012 former cricketerturnedpolitician Imran Khan described his vision for a Pakistani foreign policy on Twitter We stand for a nationalist foreign policy which envisages friendly relations with all on basis of reciprocity  in the interest of Pak he said in a social media post Khan was chair of the populist party Pakistan TehreekeInsaf which he founded in 1996 While his party placed third in general elections in 2013 losing not only to Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz but also to Asif Ali Zardaris centerleft Pakistan Peoples Party the elections solidified his status as an upandcoming political star\n\nSharif became prime minister and for the following four years until his eventual ouster by the Supreme Court as a result of the Panama Papers scandal was both an enthusiastic proponent of reviving Pakistans longstanding ties to China and a political punching bag for Khan\n\nKhan decisively won the top spot in Pakistans 2018 general elections following Sharifs fall from grace and the brief tenure of Sharif ally Shahid Khaqan Abbasi While Khan plays the populist card and tries to wrap himself as a champion of Pakistani nationalism and Islam his actions suggest the opposite By any objective standard Khan has surpassed Sharif in his willingness to subordinate and sellout Pakistani sovereignty to Chinese interests While Khan has lambasted Sharif and appears to despise him when it comes to China Khan is far more deferential to Beijing than Sharif ever was\n\nConsider the trackrecords of both premiers During Sharifs first term as prime minister 19901993 he visited China twice and convinced its leadership to assist with constructing the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex He returned to China for a week during his second term 19971999 shortly before Pakistan conducted a nuclear test a successful event to which Islamabad owed much to Beijing Just a month into his third term 20132017 Sharif returned to China and signed eight memorandums of understanding to develop a longterm plan for the ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor CPEC His rhetorical embrace of China was overthetop Our friendship is higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the deepest sea in the world and sweeter than honey he said Upon his return Sharif promised to set up a China cell in his office to supervise CPEC implementation and over the remainder of his term he hosted various implementation meetings for CPEC projects Khans nationalist criticism of Sharifs obsequiousness toward China ultimately led Pakistan to delay CPECs inauguration by several months but ultimately Xi Jinping came to Pakistan to sign fiftyone agreements worth 46 billion and formally start CPEC operations Subsequent deals only added to CPECs ambitions and value\n\nWhile many bilateral agreements begin with pomp but fade into the ether both Pakistan and China pushed ahead with their CPEC deals beginning work on several projects within the year and beginning trade over the new route in October 2016 Shortly before his dismissal Sharif returned to Beijing for a One Belt One Road conference He spoke in glowing terms about his China dealings saying the projects made winwin partnerships possible for all and promised the China deal would help in eradicating poverty in Pakistan and achieving sustainable development leaving no one behind Sartaj Aziz a prominent Sharif advisor bluntly stated that the China relationship was the cornerstone of our foreign policy\n\nOn July 28 2017 Pakistans Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from office on corruption charges It was a victory for Khan who was one of the main petitioners before the court and a frequent street agitator against Sharif who until the Panama Papers case appeared a shooin for reelection\n\nFor all of Khans nationalist and populist rhetoric however his legacy has been far more to lay Pakistan under Chinas heels He praised China in his victory speech and his early promises to review Sharifs dealings with China went nowhere Indeed while Abdul Razak Dawood Khans ministerialrank commerce and investment advisor at first explained The previous government did a bad job negotiating with China on CPECthey didnt do their homework correctly and didnt negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot Khan forced Dawood to backtrack on those comments and Khan quickly dispensed with his review and instead embraced the Sharif administrations formulation that China is the cornerstone of Pakistans foreign policy\n\nIndeed Khan quickly decamped to Beijing to beg for additional foreign assistance to offset a debt crisis in Pakistan and the following month acquiesced to a number of new Chinese projects in Pakistan involving the mining and mineral sectors as well as steel and petrochemicals In April 2019 Khan returned to Beijing and signed a number of new agreements\n\nKhan signed agreements to facilitate greater Chinese dominance within the Pakistani economy with little to suggest that impoverished Pakistanis especially in disputed areas like GilgitBaltistan would benefit He also blindly supported Chinas crackdown on Uyghur Muslims which highlighted the emptiness of Khans prior and subsequent fingerwaving on issues relating to the protection of Muslims and combating Islamophobia Likewise Khans government stifled an investigation into the sale of more than six hundred girls and women to China as brides\n\nKhans sycophancy only increased in the following months with Pakistani sovereignty becoming the primary victim Under Chinese pressure for example Khan created the CPEC Authority CPECA which enabled Beijing to bypass Pakistans National Assembly and Senate Khans administration also provided the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited COPHC which operates the Gwadar port with a twentythreeyear tax exemption Sharif and other opposition politicians labeled such concessions illegal under Pakistani law but Khan pushed ahead anyway in his efforts to appease Chinese interests And indeed such appeasement continued as in the past year Khan sold other concessions and assets to China While Khan has spoken about the relationship as a lifeline to the Pakistani economy the opposite is true While Pakistan exports 2 billion worth of goods to China it imports more than six times as much from China Cheap Chinese manufacturing and dumped goods continue to erode the Pakistani industrial base\n\nThat Pakistan should have relations with communist China is not the problem After all it was through Pakistans offices that Nixonera Ping Pong diplomacy and Secretary of State Henry Kissingers secret trip to Beijing became possible There is a qualitative difference however between maintaining good neighborly relations and the wholesale betrayal of both Pakistani sovereignty and given the ongoing genocide against the Uyghurs Islam as well Perhaps not since Vidkun Quisling has there been a politician who has so willingly and enthusiastically sold out his countrys sovereignty Sharif came close but Khan has surpassed even his example\n\nMichael Rubin is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a frequent author for the National

earlier accused of hatching the conspiracy that led to the demolition of the 15thcentury mosque in December 1992 They attended the proceedings via video conferencing 26 out of 32 accused were present

to past instances of sexual assault and sexual abuse Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein received a 23year prison sentence\n\n Hong Kong China imposed a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong The ensuing crackdown on dissent effectively voided Chinas pledge to allow the city to maintain rights promised for 50 years following the 1997 handover from British colonial rule The arrests of leading opposition figures and the expulsion of local lawmakers  prompting the entire opposition camp to resign led numerous countries to curtail legal cooperation with Hong Kong The US Imposed travel bans and financial sanctions\n\n FranceMuslims The October beheading of a teacher by an 18yearold Chechen outside Paris followed by the killing of three people in Nice by a Tunisian migrant prompted France to declare its highestlevel security alert The attacks came amid a trial over the 2015 massacre at the satiric newspaper Charlie Hebdo which had published cartoons of Islams prophet The teacher was beheaded for showing the cartoons to his class while discussing freedom of expression  vigorously defended by President Emmanuel Macron The caricatures and Macrons stance fueled calls from Muslim nations to boycott French products and some French Muslims resented the security crackdown\n\nLive TV"

		"Language" : "en",
		"Summary" : "Kailash Vijayvargiya BJP general secretary and partys West Bengal incharge\n\nThe confrontation between the BJPled Centre and TMCgoverned West Bengal government is likely to intensify in the coming days with the BJP keen on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee targeting the saffron party and inadvertently helping the party project itself as the main challenger Party leaders expect this to further diminish the Congress and the Left Front as potential challengers in the narrative before next years Assembly polls\n\nWhile the faceoff has been highpitched since before the Lok Sabha polls with pitched battles allegedly involving workers of the two parties and accusations from both sides of being attacked by the other it was cranked up a notch last week when BJP president J P Naddas convoy was attacked on the outskirts of Kolkata\n\nSources in BJP said the party wants the Centre to take action against officials who were seen as negligent in the attack They said the widely held view is that imposition of Presidents Rule for the collapsing law and order situation could boomerang and Banerjee could use it to draw public sympathy But they also said that the tension between BJP and TMC should remain as that could keep the BJP up in the perception battle against the states ruling party\n\nKailash Vijayvargiya BJP general secretary and partys West Bengal incharge told The Indian Express It is anarchy law and order has completely collapsed in the state and the ruling party has crossed all limits of democratic values and constitutional proprieties Its the fittest case for imposition of Presidents Rule\n\nExplained BJP wants a direct battle with TMC The political battle in West Bengal is now perceived as one between the TMC and the BJP This is exactly what the BJP wants  to make it a TMC versus BJP political battle in peoples minds and relegate to the sidelines the other two big players the Left Front and the Congress which are expected to contest the polls together The party wanted Mamata Banerjee and her party to target its leaders to create the narrative of a direct contest and the Centres decision to replace a mild Keshari Nath Tripathi as Governor with Jagdeep Dhankhar who has been on a warpath with the state government since taking charge is seen as having helped that\n\nFor BJP Vijayvargiya said the battle is only getting intensified We have decided to take it up with the people We will continue our fight no matter how much violence is unleashed on us After Naddajis visit Home Minister Amit Shah is coming later this week December 1920 and that will infuse more confidence among the workers he said\n\nOn demands for Presidents Rule a person involved in BJPs electioneering process in West Bengal said The Chief Minister will make a hue and cry over that and could create sympathy in favour of TMC So the BJP does not want that drastic step imposing Presidents Rule for the time being However we want action to be taken against officials so that the heat is on\n\nOther than the absence of a strong cadre to match that of TMC the fear factor has also been a hurdle for the BJP leadership to extract full commitment and hard work from the cadre party leaders said There is violence everywhere Our workers are getting attacked and killed Vijayvargiya said\n\nThere have been similar allegations against the saffron party from TMC leaders\n\nAfter Nadda took over the partys reins and revamped his team in several states he did not move either Vijayvargiya or Shiv Prakash an RSS pracharak loaned to BJP who has been the joint general secretary in charge of Bengal Both have been working in the state for long and played key roles in the partys impressive performance in 2019 General Election when it won 18 of 42 Lok Sabha seats\n\nThe party also appointed Arvind Menon and Amit Malaviya head of its national IT cell as coin charges With an eye to keep the heat on TMC the party has also given a free hand to hardliner Dilip Ghosh the state unit president to take on Banerjee and her party aggressively\n\nThe party has appointed a battery of lawyers in each district to support BJP workers in the legal process as the battle intensifies Five sanghatan mantris have been appointed in the states five zones and there is constant communication between the workers and leaders party leaders pointed out BJP national secretaries and Union ministers are also visiting each zone at least once in two weeks to keep this communication channel open they said\n\nAnimesh Biswas national executive member of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha who has been camping in Kolkata for the last few months said After J P Naddas visit Amit Shahs visit next week will be the biggest morale boost for party workers here The TMC leadership is trying to instil fear among BJP workers to jeopardise the electoral process But by keeping the communication channels open between party workers and senior leaders we are trying to keep the morale up\n\n The Indian Express is now on Telegram Click here to join our channel indianexpress and stay updated with the latest headlines\n\nFor all the latest India News download Indian Express App"

		"Summary" : "1 hour ago wionnewswebgmailcom Chris Buckley  2020 The New York Times\n\n Provided by WION\n\nIn one Beijing artists recent depiction of the world in 2098 China is a hightech superpower and the United States is humbled Americans have embraced communism and Manhattan draped with the hammerandsickle flags of the Peoples Union of America has become a quaint tourist precinct\n\nThis triumphant vision has resonated among Chinese\n\nThe scifi digital illustrations by the artist Fan Wennan caught fire on Chinese social media in recent months reflecting a resurgent nationalism Chinas authoritarian system proponents say is not just different from the Wests democracies it is also proving itself superior It is a longrunning theme but Chinas success against the pandemic has given it a sharp boost\n\nAlso read Why is Chinese colonisation a severe threat for foreign countries\n\nAmerica isnt that heavenly kingdom depicted since decades ago said Fan who is in his early 20s Theres nothing special about it If you have to say theres anything special about it now its how messed up it can be at times\n\nChinas Communist Party under its leader Xi Jinping has promoted the idea that the country is on a trajectory to power past Western rivals\n\nChina stamped out the coronavirus the messaging goes with a resolve beyond the reach of flailing Western democracies Beijing has rolled out homegrown vaccines to more than 1 million people despite the safety concerns of scientists Chinas economy has revived defying fears of a deep slump from the pandemic\n\nIn this fight against the pandemic there will be victorious powers and defeated ones Wang Xiangsui a retired Chinese senior colonel who teaches at a university in Beijing averred this month Were a victor power while the United States is still mired and I think may well become a defeated power\n\nAlso read How is CCP using United Front Work Department for its sinister agendas\n\nThe firm leadership of Xi and the party has earned China its recent success say newspapers television programs and social media\n\nTime to wake up from blind faith in the Western system said a commentary in the staterun China Education News last week Vicious partisan fighting has worsened in certain Western countries social fissures have deepened and a severe social crisis is brewing\n\nChinas current swaggering mood could add to the challenges facing Joe Biden when he takes office as president President Donald Trumps defeat in the election has done little to ease Chinese suspicion of the United States said Liu Jianqiu a businessman and online commentator in a telephone interview\n\nAlso read Two million members of Chinese Communist Party infiltrating worlds biggest companies Report\n\nI think China has gained the psychological edge said Liu in his 40s who described the pandemic as a turning point in his attitudes The performance of the West was completely out of my expectations and shifted my thinking even more  the facts prove that the American system really has no superiority\n\nCombative national pride surged in China in the runup to the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and after the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade Yugoslavia in 1999 Now there is a sharper sense that the Western powers are in perhaps irreversible decline and that the pandemic has confirmed Chinas ascent\n\nMost ordinary Chinese people previously were more admiring of the United States but in recent years the advantages of the Chinese system have become clearer to them said Jin Canrong an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing who has become a popular commentator under the nickname Commissar Jin Theres greater selfconfidence\n\nChinas diplomats and its staterun media have responded to criticism from Western governments with scornful disdain Chinese supporters of a more muscular foreign policy call for hitting back against Western critics especially in the wake of the pandemic\n\nLe Yucheng a Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs said in a speech last week that China was not spoiling for fights but he also warned other governments not to underestimate its resolve to push back against criticism\n\nFaced with this suppression and containment without scruples Le said well never swallow our pride or stoop to compromise\n\nOnline Chinese commentators have plumbed the depths of history to capture the current moment Some likened the United States to the crumbling British Empire of the last century overstretched and exhausted\n\nOthers are reaching back further comparing America to Chinas own Ming dynasty which crumbled in the 1600s under the weight of corruption insurrections and invasions In this view that spread online this year China should take the role of the barbarian Manchu armies who  in the commentators vivid notalwaysaccurate retelling  swept over the Asian steppes breached the Great Wall and crushed the Ming rulers\n\nModernday China must act like the Manchu forces advocates of the analogy say and prepare to break through a ring of geopolitical hostility by dominating vital seas around China\n\nGeremie R Barmé a Sinologist in New Zealand who has followed the rise of breakthrough studies  rùguānxué in Chinese  said the historical comparisons reflect anxiety about Chinas great nation status and its place in the world\n\nThe underpinning is that China is morally superior  we the Chinese people under the Communist Party  because we have none of the failings of America he said\n\nChinas leader Xi has not commented on the recent pronouncements of American decline But he sees China and the United States as locked in ideological rivalry Since coming to power in 2012 he has called for Chinese schools textbooks and websites to inoculate youth against Western values that could erode party rule and the countrys cultural selfconfidence\n\nOur schooling must never nurture wreckers or gravediggers of socialism Xi said in a speech in 2018 that was recently published in a book of his comments on ideology\n\nSome warn that China risks underestimating the strengths of the United States In recent months Chinese scholars have debated how Beijing should handle the postCOVID world with a good number urging restraint as the best way to win lasting influence\n\nChinas highvolume nationalism at home is making the United States feel that China is getting aggressive Xiao Gongqin a historian in Shanghai wrote in an essay that was published last month prompting wide discussion\n\nThe United States is far from the only country feeling the lash of official and public anger from China Australia has drawn Chinas ire for criticizing Beijing initiating laws aimed at reducing Chinese government influencebuilding efforts in Australia and urging an investigation into the origin of the pandemic  a touchy subject in Beijing\n\nLast month a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson tweeted a Chinese artists fabricated image of an Australian soldier poised to slit the throat of an Afghan child Australias prime minister Scott Morrison demanded an apology from China over the image which was a reference to an inquiry by the Australian military that found that its troops had unlawfully killed more than three dozen Afghan civilians\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry scoffed at Morrisons demand and the artist who created the image Fu Yu created another one mocking the Australian leader Fu who works under the name Wuhe Qilin had made a reputation with his scathing images of the United States as a bloodsoaked irrational medieval realm\n\nChinese values and American values are totally at odds Fu said late last month on a Chinese online talk show broadcast last week These values are in fundamental conflict"

		"Summary" : " Provided by The Indian Express\n\nThe Election Commissions EC proposal to grant postal voting rights to NonResident Indians NRIs may get implemented first for voters based in the US Canada New Zealand Japan Australia Germany France and South Africa The Indian Express has learnt\n\nThe EC and the Ministry of External Affairs MEA held a meeting last week in which the latter sources said agreed to the proposal on the condition that the Commission should arrange the manpower needed at the India missions abroad to facilitate postal voting for NRIs\n\nThe poll panel has also indicated to the MEA the countries where it would like to have postal voting introduced on a pilot basis For now Gulf countries are not part of the proposed pilot given the reservations earlier expressed by the ministry over seeking permission in nondemocratic nations to facilitate postal voting for India citizens living there\n\nAccording to sources in the meeting held last week with MEA the EC is learned to have proposed that a designated officer in the Indian mission download the ballot paper on the voters behalf and hand it over The overseas elector can then mark her preference at the mission get the selfdeclaration form attested by the designated officers and hand back the ballot paper and declaration form in a sealed envelope to the mission which will then dispatch all the envelopes to the election officer concerned\n\nAs first reported by The Indian Express on December 1 the EC approached the Law Ministry last month to permit NRIs to cast their votes overseas through postal ballots The Commission told the government that it had received representations from the Indian diaspora about facilitating voting through postal votes since travelling to India for elections was a costly affair\n\nThe EC informed the government that it is technically and administratively ready to extend the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System ETPBS to voters abroad for elections next year in Assam West Bengal Kerala Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nUnder ETPBS which is currently only available to those in the defence services the postal ballot is dispatched electronically and returned via ordinary mail To extend this facility to overseas voters the government only needs to amend the Conduct of Election Rules 1961\n\nThe proposal comes a year after the Bill that proposed to extend proxy voting to overseas Indians lapsed with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha\n\nCurrently voters residing abroad can only cast their votes in their respective constituencies This regulation is seen as restrictive as only a little over a crore Indians living overseas have registered as voters the maximum being from Kerala\n\nAccording to the Commissions proposal any NRI interested in voting through the postal ballot in an election will have to inform the Returning Officer RO at least five days after the notification of the election On receiving such information the RO will dispatch the ballot paper electronically\n\nTop News Right Now\n\nClick here for more\n\nThe EC first began to look for options to enable NRIs to vote from overseas after it received several requests including one from former Rajya Sabha MP and industrialist Naveen Jindal and the Ministry of Overseas Affairs and after three writ petitions were filed by NRIs in the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2014 A 12member committee was set up after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to study mainly three options  voting by post voting at an Indian mission abroad and online voting\n\nThe committee ruled out online polling as it felt this could compromise secrecy of voting It also shot down the proposal to vote at Indian missions abroad as they do not have adequate resources In 2015 the panel finally recommended that NRIs should be given the additional alternative options of epostal ballot and proxy voting apart from voting in person"

		"Summary" : "Representational image  Photo Credit ANI\n\nKey Highlights India reported one of the lowest cases per million population in the world 158 in the last 7 days The world average of the past seven days was 553 cases per million France recorded 1252 cases per million Russia 1330 cases Brazil 1387 cases the UK 1753 Italy 1934 and the US 4310 COVID19 cases per million population in the same period\n\nIndia has recorded one of the lowest daily coronavirus cases and daily death counts due to COVID19 per million population in the past week according to government data\n\nIndia reported one of the lowest cases per million population in the world 158 in the last 7 days much lower than many other countries of the Western Hemisphere the Union Health Ministry said in a statement\n\nThe world average of the past seven days was 553 cases per million with many advanced countries recording high figures  France 1252 cases Russia 1330 cases Brazil 1387 cases the UK 1753 Italy 1934 and the US 4310 COVID19 cases per million population in the same period\n\nIndia has recorded a case fatalities per million population of 2 in the past seven days the central government data shows Again this too compares favourably with the rest of the world The world average is ten new deaths per million population in the past seven days Italy is the worst affected at 75 deaths while the USA 49 deaths France 43 the UK 43 deaths Russia 26 and Brazil 23 deaths per million population in the past seven days due to COVID19 were also badly hit\n\nThe trend of more daily recoveries than the daily cases has led to a continuous contraction of Indias active caseload the Health Ministry said\n\nThough India will soon reach a reported case count of 1 crore it is clear that the doomsday scenario of tens of lakhs of people dying of COVID has thankfully not happened While the vaccination rollout is expected by February the precise reasons for the decline in cases in India are still something of a puzzle But some experts feel that they may have a plausible explanation\n\nExplaining the numbers\n\nPut simply the number of Indians who were actually infected due to the coronavirus at some point or the other since March is much much higher than the reported numbers  this is what some experts believe\n\nThats the only way they feel one can explain the fact that the countrys daily case count has remained below 50000 in the last six weeks despite the festive season elections and a farmers protest that has engulfed at least three states\n\nEach of these were and are potentially superspreader events but that kind of spike in cases has not been seen in most parts of the country except perhaps in Delhi where the recorded case count shot up due to the Diwali shopping season when lakhs of Delhi residents stepped out to the citys crowded bazaars\n\nSo according to these experts a drastically high number of Indians perhaps even more than half of the entire population may have already caught the virus leading to the prevalence of natural herd immunity\n\nManindra Agarwal a researcher from IIT Kanpur who was part of a governmentappointed committee that mapped the trajectory of the pandemic in the country using a mathematical model told The Indian Express that the model predicted that as of December 12 a whopping 55 per cent of the population may have been infected\n\nThat is much higher than what the various serosurveys have been predicting Why the serosurveys have not been able to capture this plausible massive spike is a matter of debate\n\nAccording to the model Agrawal and his team were working with the disease prevalence is as high as 65 per cent in Bihar the Express report says\n\nIf this theory is correct it indicates that a vast number of Indians contracted the virus without even being aware of it or got a very mild form of the disease which was akin to a common cold\n\nMore research is however needed to conclusively prove what some of these experts are suggesting"
