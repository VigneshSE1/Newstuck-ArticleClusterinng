			"Summary" : "A few years ago over 100 kg of gold went missing from CBI custody Seized in connection with a 2012 case from Surana Corporation the investigative agency is yet to recover the missing gold worth around Rs 43 crore\n\nNow in most cases missing valuables would be cause for an official agency to investigate But this poses something of a problem when the victim in question is the countrys top investigative agency As such the CBI had contended that an investigation by local officials would lower its prestige This contention however appears to have failed to move the Madras High Court which on Friday turned down the CBI petition and ordered the Tamil Nadu police to launch a probe\n\nThe CBI would have cried foul from the rooftops and demanded the scalp of the Special Judge and his property clerk The Special Judge and the property clerk would have been placed under suspension and would have even been arrested a News18 report quoted the judge as saying"

			"Summary" : " Provided by Hindustan Times\n\nThe Lancet on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens Commission on Reimagining Indias Health System which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage UHC in India The work of the commission will begin on Friday with an aim to publish a final report of its findings and recommendations in the next two years\n\nThe Lancet a global health journal and the Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute Harvard University together formulated the commission which will be led by four distinguished health and business leadersGagandeep Kang a professor at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory of Christian Medical College Vellore and one of Indias leading scientists Tarun Khanna Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor Harvard Business School Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute Harvard University and Director Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute Kiran Mazumdar Shaw CMD Biocon Ltd and Vikram Patel Professor in the Department of Global Health and Population at Harvard Medical School and founder of Sangath They have brought together 13 experts from academia the scientific community civil society and private healthcare to serve with them on the Commission\n\nThe mission of the Lancet Citizens Commission is to lay out the path to achieving UHC in India in the coming decade The commission will take a participatory approach with engagement of all sectors engaged in healthcare and citizens We expect that the commission will formulate a roadmap for realising a resilient health system that offers comprehensive accountable accessible inclusive and affordable quality health care to all citizens in India Although we recognise the important role that social determinants have in influencing health the focus of the Commission will be on the architecture of Indias health systema commentary in Lancet India said on Thursday\n\nThe commentary also said that despite progress in health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality disease burden in India is disproportionately high and that less than twothirds of children were fully immunised in 201718 malnutrition and other risk factors for disease and injury are widespread The commission observed that the Covid 19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Indias health system ranging from inadequate medical supplies and shortage of health care workers in public hospitals to profiteering by private hospitals Outofpocket payments for health care in India continue to be among the leading causes of poverty for many households An estimated 400 million people could fall deeper into poverty In the coming year as Indias gross domestic product contracts by a projected 103 The pandemic could worsen health disparities since much of the public health system has been redeployed in the Covid19 response the commentary said\n\nData from Indias National Health Mission showed there was a 64 decrease in child immunisation a 50 drop in BCG vaccinations and a 39 fall in oral polio immunisation in April 2020 compared with January 2020\n\nThe commission organised a webinar on Monday where Dr Vinod Paul member Niti Ayog said Ayushman Bharat and Digital Health Mission have laid the path towards UHC A few significant big tickets steps have been taken in the past few years On the human resource front I assure you that we will achieve a doctor patient ratio of 1 per 1000 which is the WHO norm by 2024 Our public spending has to increase we made a commitment to go to 25 of GDP by 2025 which we will follow through Our 15TH Finance Commission has also put weight behind it Twothirds of spending on health comes from state governments State spending should be disaggregated said Paul adding We have a chronic problem of human resources Our specialist scarcity is huge The Commission should think about that granularity We have 20 to 25 of what we should have We need five times the number of paediatricians we have today We cannot do without specialists The Commission also needs to work on infrastructure We have just about one bed per 1000 population Under the national health policy we aspire to be 2 beds per 1000 population\n\nWHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the index thats now used was developed years ago which looks at 14 indicators focused on process indicators We wanted to measure UHC by looking at health outcomes and impact So instead of focusing on distribution of ORS in primary health centres as a management of childhood diarrhoea lets look at mortality incidence ratio for diarrhoea India could innovate in the measurement system to move ahead We have proposed a new UHC measuring index\n\nGagandeep Kang said that all stakeholders will be consulted Engagement must start with listening to issues perspectives goals and preferences of all stakeholders which includes the designers providers and recipients of healthcare services In the next year or so we will make sure we use every opportunity to listen and engage so our framing of a reliable efficient and accountable healthcare system can be realised in ten years\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper

			"Summary" : "Harish Murali By\n\nExpress News Service\n\nCHENNAI At times crime thrives right under the nose of law The Madras High Court on Friday ordered a CBCID probe after it was found that 100kg of gold had gone missing from CBI custody The crime was noticed after the vault supposed to contain 400kg of the yellow metal that was seized by the central agency from a private importer in 2012 was opened\n\nThe court wondered why the CBI should not be booked for theft The National Company Law Tribunal in 2019 had ordered the CBI to hand over the gold bullion to the liquidator of the company so that the proceeds can be distributed among banks that lent money to the company However when the vault was opened only 296kg gold was found in it as against the original 400 kg\n\nThe CBI could not account for the remaining 103864 kgs The difference is not a few grams its a whopping 1 lakh grams observed the court Comparing it to narcotics laws the court pointed out that in such cases the quantum of punishment is directly proportional to the quant i ty of the contraband The CBI in its defense said that while handing over the gold to the liquidator it was weighed individually and that was the reason for the discrepancy\n\nHowever Justice PN Prakash refused to accept this submission Though the Special Public Prosecutor of the CBI contended that the prestige of the CBI would come down if the investigation is done by the local police Justice PN Prakash in his order observed that  the law does not sanction such an inference\n\nAll policemen have to be trusted and it does not lie in the mouth of one to say that the CBI has special horns whereas the local police have only a tail In 2012 the search was conducted in the office of Surana Corporation Limited in Chennai on a corruption case registered against the company and officials of MMTC\n\nFlashback How 400kg gold came into CBI custody\n\nTHE primary allegation was that MMTC had shown undue favour to Surana for importing gold and silver\n\nThe chronology of events\n\nAs many as 40047 kgs of gold in the form of bullions and ornaments were seized The seized gold was kept in the lockers and vaults of Surana under the seal of CBI The CBI in its arguments said that they handed over the 72 keys of the vaults to the Chennai principal special court for CBI cases\n\nIn 2013 CBI filed a closure report holding that the accused had not committed any offence and has only violated certain circulars for which departmental action was recommended against the officials During the hearing the CBI requested the special court to transfer the gold to the office of the directorgeneral of foreign trade DGFT However Surana challenged the transfer of gold\n\nIn the meantime insolvency proceedings were initiated by SBI against Surana for pending dues of Rs 1160 crore and the bank moved the court seeking the gold in order to resolve the dues from the company On December 12 2017 SBI and Surana filed a compromise memo in the court and sought a direction to hand over the gold to SBI which was opposed by the CBI\n\nOn July 16 2019 the court directed the parties to approach the National Company Law Tribunal before and CBI was directed to hand over the possession of the gold to SBI On December 27 2019 the NCLT ordered to hand over of the gold to the official liquidator in the presence of SBI\n\nThe gold googly\n\nThe court also in its order brought out possibilities on the missing gold that required investigation  the CBI officials in collusion with the panchas and others may have illegally dealt with the gold while maintaining the weight as 400 kg In the seizure mahazar as a shortfall therein would have made Surana cry foul Secondly the CBI officials in collusion with Surana and others may have permitted Surana to deal with 100 and odd kgs after effecting the seizure\n\n72 keys handed over to principal special court\n\nOver 400 kg of gold in the form of bullions and ornaments were seized It was kept in the lockers and vaults of Surana under the seal of CBI The CBI in its arguments said it handed over 72 keys of the vaults to the Chennai principal special court for CBI cases"

			"Summary" : "A feature of Dravidian politics since the 50s is the extraordinary influence that movies and film stars wield Even though other states have elected movie stars to power the consistent stream of movie stars that articulate and follow through on political ambitions is a unique feature of Tamil Nadu and their coastal cousins to the North the Telugus\n\nThis was not so at its inception In fact the earlier avatar of the Dravidian movement the Justice Party were upperclass social conservatives who looked down upon entertainers and the industry as infra dig\n\nThat same conservatism was reflected in Periyar EV Ramasamys attitude towards the movie industry people that formed the propaganda arm of the DMK He frequently called them koothadis  a Tamil term that can only be translated into Hindi as nachaniya\n\nHow did movies and actors become so closely intertwined with the politics of the State To understand that we must take a little tour across time and space that begins with Europe of the 30s\n\nMovies as mass propaganda\n\nThe November 1932 German federal election was a disappointment to the Nazi Party which lost 34 seats 4 of vote share and could not form a Government on its own After talks with Gregor Strasser to form a coalition with a breakaway faction of the Nazis failed Chancellor Strasser made a deal to form a coalition with Adolf Hitler as Chancellor In endFebruary the Reichstag was set fire by arsonists and snap elections were announced within days The Nazi stormtroopers by now ruled the streets and were able to steal the elections by massive violence against Communists CentreRight Conservatives and the Social Democratic Party\n\nThis was an experience that Hitler was determined never to repeat He and the Nazi Party then hit upon the formula of using the emerging medium of movies as a tool of propaganda It was at the same time that a brilliant young woman called Leni Riefensthal began to make movies\n\nThe Nazis won the popular vote and formed the Government in March 1933 Within weeks Hitler passed an act giving himself dictatorial powers and also banned all other parties\n\nIn August and September the Nazis began the first of their grand rallies in Nuremberg Rather than simple party conferences these were brilliantly choreographed spectacles modelled on the pomp and pageantry of ancient Rome Leni had a full reign of affairs and made a movie Der Sieg des Glaubens  The Victory of Faith  which showed the party conference and took great pains in highlighting the leaders of the movement as heroic figures\n\nShe followed it up with the classic Triumph des Willens which was a record of the 1935 Nuremberg Rally The intricate choreography and the combination of heroic themes from Wagner and the camera shots turned the Fuhrer Hitler into something of a mythic figure\n\nOther Powers were quick to take note Hollywood followed up with highquality war propaganda films in the 40s The Soviets also took note The Soviet propaganda news reels of the Second World War and the postWar eulogizing of Stalin were impressive in their effectiveness\n\nTamil Movies as Propaganda\n\nTamil talkies began to be produced in the 1930s There were several factors that shaped the industry in its early years  the usage of actors scripts themes and directors from the stage industry and the taste of the general public In order to dodge criticisms of being entertainment of poor virtue these movies mostly had Puranic themes A few social movies were made but due to heavy censorship political themes were few and far between\n\nInto this environment a young man from a Vishwakarma goldsmith family Mayavaram Krishnamurthy Thiyagarajan stepped in with a movie called Pavalakkodi in 1934 His singing voice and suave looks made him the first Tamil superstar Between PU Chinnappa T R Mahalingam and M K Radha it was MKT or Thyagaraja Bhagavatar as he was known by then who stood head and shoulders above the rest\n\nAt the same time N S Krishnan was a comedic genius and the first comic star of Tamil movies With his wife T A Mathuram they made a comic pair that worked very successfully He himself made a few films that were spoofs of ancient Puranic stories and folklore In one of his movies Chandrahari a reversal of the name Harishchandra he played a king who refused to speak a single word of truth These films were quite successful and there was a mild element of lampooning Hindu beliefs and an undercurrent of antiBrahminism in his films\n\nTowards the beginning of the war many of the senior artists in the movie industry were influenced by Congress principles and the freedom movement K B Sundarambal MS Subbulakshmi were among the leading nationalist stars They sang about Gandhi ji Prohibition homespun khadar the charka and acted in nationalist themed films that spoke for widow remarriage against untouchability and so on These social themes were the platform for the Congress brand of nationalism and thus drew people into the nationalist cause\n\nMS Subbulakshmis husband Kalki Sadasivam was a Congressman and between him the leading producers K Subramanyam and SS Vasan the movie business was influenced with a nationalistic fervour as yet unseen elsewhere in India\n\nSeva Sadanam Thyaga Bhoomi were blockbusters Thyaga Bhoomi 1939 had visuals of Gandhi ji spinning the charka and Congress volunteers courting arrest\n\nThe Justice Party had banned a few nationalist movies when it was in power but once the Congress took power in Madras Presidency in 1937 there was little hindrance from the authorities as long as no direct negative references were made to the Crown or the British Clearly the Congress and the nationalist movement were winning at this propaganda game\n\nThe Muckraker\n\nC N Lakshmikanthan was an exconvict who had completed a 7year sentence in 1939 He started a magazine called Cine Thoothu Cine Courier It had to be shut down on orders for poor quality journalism in the form of unverified rumours He started Hindu Nesan Hindu Nationalist which was in the same mould His stockintrade was gossip about prominent people in society mostly related to their sex lives The identity of people was very thinly veiled and put in a way that it would be unmistakable He made a living by blackmailing people to stop publication of their stories in his magazine\n\nLakshmikanthan was an exconvict with good contacts among the roughnecks of Madras of the day He just shrugged off the threats and in one instance himself beat up the thug who had been sent to threaten him\n\nIn 1944 he was stabbed by a group of men in the evening and succumbed to injuries the next day\n\nJail\n\nBoth Thyagaraja Bhagavatar and NS Krishnan were among the accused They were convicted and sentenced to jail on counts of conspiracy to murder The two appealed in the Privy Council in London which referred the case back to the Madras High Court By the time the appeal was heard and acquittal issued 30 months had passed by and the year was 1947 India got Independence a few months later AVM Studios movie Naam Iruvar came out which was probably the last nationalistCongress themed movie for a while\n\nDravidian movies\n\nAfter their release MKT and NSKs careers and lives took different trajectories but still continued with themes of loss and difficulties\n\nMKT tried producing movies for himself but he continued with the old Puranic themes He continued to be avowedly apolitical and refused to renounce or hide his faith in the Gods and in the Hindu religion He was shunned by the music sabhas and his movies didnt do well After his release he only made 4 films none of which did well before his death in 1959\n\nNSK however made a comeback and got roles as a comedian in movies He home production Nallathambi of 1949 introduced C N Annadurai as the script writer\n\nRandor Guy the Tamil movie historian recounts in his 1997 book Starlight Starbright that popular opinion held that both the major stars implicated in the case were innocent and had been framed He also says that when he tried to investigate this in the 1970s he was politely warned to stay off the story\n\nThe same year that he made his debut in the movies Annadurai broke away from the parent Dravidar Kazhagam to form the political outfit Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam which till date is the primary electoral and political vehicle of the Dravidian movement Nallathambi released in February and the DMK was formed in September\n\nAnother young member of the DMK M Karunanidhi began his career as a staff scriptwriter in 1946 in Coimbatores Jupiter Pictures His breakout hit Manthirikumari in 1950 also was the breakout movie for a young actor called M G Ramachandran\n\nRamachandran who was a khadarwearing Congressman came under the influence of Annadurai and joined the DMK in 1953\n\nKarunanidhis major hit with dialogues 1952s Parasakthi also launched the other Tamil super star of the 60s Sivaji Ganesan\n\nSivaji managed to balance his religious faith with the careerboosting atheismthemed movies for some time However his popularity and his refusal to toe the party line made him a target A smear campaign was run against him when he visited the temple at Tirupati He broke away from the Dravidian movement then\n\nStrangely the Congress in Tamil Nadu never thought much of using the medium of cinema to the same extent that the DMK did\n\nFrom 1967 onwards until the death of Jayalalitha in 2016 for 49 years the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was always someone from the film industry or their proxy\n\nThe impact\n\nThe impact of this case was far reaching The dominance of Dravidian ideology would have taken a much longer time since the popularity of Thyagaraja Bhagavatar was at its peak His last film before he was jailed  Bhakta Haridas  had the distinction of staying in theatres for three Deepavalis\n\nThe sudden exit of these two stalwarts and the full cooption of NS Krishnan gave the Dravidian movement its springboard into the Tamil movie industry\n\nHispanic Popular Culture in the Americas\n\nSuch cultural mass extinction events have happened twice elsewhere  in the Mexican film industry and the plane crash that claimed the lives of Buddy Holly Richie Valens and JP Richardson which slowed down the commercial success of Spanish language rock and roll\n\nThe Mexican film industry went through a very successful period in the 1940s There was a possibility of the industry going on to dominate the Spanish speaking world which at that time was close to the Englishspeaking audience in numbers though not in revenue\n\nIn 1953 the star Jorge Negrete died of cirrhosis after a trip to Los Angeles at the age of 49 His contemporary Pedro Infante died in a plane crash at the age of 40 in 1957 Their successor Javier Solis died at 35 in 1966\n\nBetween these deaths the entry of television in the 1950s and lack of funds sent the industry into a long period of decline from the 1960s to 1990s During the same period English language films went on to attract the best funds technology and auteurs and dominate the cultural landscape of the world\n\nThe postWorld War II Baby Boomer generation of America was the first that made popular music a cultural commodity that could drive attitudes trends and viewpoints Before this generation came of age in the 1950s the foundation for the popular music of the next few decades were being laid in rockandroll acts White American artistes took the tunes and chords of black blues and soul music and creating the new popular sound\n\nA 16yearold Hispanic artiste  Richie Valens  made a dramatic entry in 1957 His 1958 hit single La Bamba was one of the earliest Spanishlanguage rockandroll numbers that made it to the Billboard charts An Americawide Spanishlanguage rockandroll market remained still born after Ritchie Valens died in a plane crash in 1959 in which the other stars of the era  Buddy Holly and JP Richardson  also died\n\nTo this day Spanish language music and Spanish movies continue to play second fiddle to English movies and music acts\n\nIn the same way after the removal of the major stars Tamil movies took a direction that has not changed to this day"

			"Summary" : "On Thursday December 10 the Bharatiya Kisan Union EktaUgrahan the biggest group among the 32 organisations demanding the repeal of the three farm laws marked Human Rights Day by demanding the release of all rights activists and intellectuals who are lodged in prison\n\nThe event at Delhis Tikri border marked the farmer movements broadening with farmers union leaders asking for the release of political prisoners or academics lawyers and activists held under oppressive laws over dubious charges\n\nA section of mainstream media had been quick to brand the demand a hijacking of the farmers movement by Leftist intellectuals The following statement released by the BKU Ugrahan offers an idea as to why the protesters decided to add another cause to their agenda\n\n\n\nThe intellectuals whose release we are demanding are those who have stood firm against the oppressive and communal attacks waged by the Modi government on Indian society They have made huge sacrifices and are now braving a life in prison but they have never shied away from their duty to speak truth to power and communicate this truth to the people\n\nWith their pen art and speech they have exposed the communal and pro corporate agendas of the BJP government They have raised their voice in support of the Adivasis whose rights have been violated by the government just so as to facilitate the greed of the corporate and business class\n\nActivists like Stan Swamy have spent their lives in the forests of Jharkhand Intellectuals like Sudha Bhardwaj have dedicated all their knowledge and educational qualification for the upliftment of poor workers They have given up every kind of comfort and luxury and made the service of workers their mission\n\nTheir only fault is that they have stood firm against the procorporate policies of antipeople governments They have played a critical role in creating awareness organizing and mobilising those who are being oppressed  the people of Kashmir women Dalits adivasis and all others who are oppressed and marginalised in our country\n\nCompanies like Vedanta could not deter their resolve with all their dollars And this is why they have become targets of false allegations Sometimes they are labelled urban Naxals sometimes antinational and sometimes they have been called the tukde tukde gang We must remember that such allegations have been levelled against not only these intellectuals and activists but also so many innocent young men and women among all these oppressed and marginalised sections This includes people whose families were first targeted during communal violence in Delhi and later they themselves were accused of that very violence and thrown in jails under draconian laws\n\nAs such is it not our duty that we speak up for and embolden the voice of these warriors of truth We have not raised our voice for them for the first time We have been voicing our concerns ever since emergencylike provisions were being created during the COVID19 pandemic lockdown The demand for the release of the intellectuals and activists has been put forth right from the beginning of our current struggle\n\nTheir photographs have been put up across sites of dharnas and protests in Punjab The demand is also included in the charter of demands that we put in front of the Central government Not only has this been included in our organisations list of demands it has also been raised by the platform of 30 kisan organisations The entire democratic movement in Punjab has been raising the demand for their release ever since they have been targeted by the government By resisting and opposing the poisonous communal propaganda of the Modi government in the past 6 years Punjab has been a beacon of hope for the entire country\n\nFor people of Punjab targeting these intellectuals and activists is akin to targeting prominent journalists like Charanjit Bhullar and Davinderpal and activists like Professor Jagmohan Singh nephew of Shaheed Bhagat Singh in order to silence people speaking for human rights The state wants to ensure that nobody takes up cases of human rights activists in the courts It would be like putting theatre activists performing in villages to make people aware of their rights in jail It would be like putting late theatre artist Gursharan Singh in jail for his acts of resistance against state repression\n\nAlso read A List of Activists Scholars and Scribes Whose Personal Liberty Remains at Judiciarys Mercy\n\nSocially engaged intellectuals have informed the farmers about the reality of farm laws They have exposed the true character of the laws touted as welfare measures These people have been targeted by the ruling class and hence are implicated in false cases Raising out voice for these propeople activists mean raising our voice for the people It also means enabling them to continue with the important work of exposing antipeople policies of the state Mobilising support for these activists means strengthening these voices and being on the side of justice\n\nViolation of human rights in rampant in our society We have consistently raised our voice against such violations We unconditionally stand for human rights of workers from all the castes religions races regions and languages We do not speak for any specific section of the society We support all ideological struggles against communal politics We are strongly against those who violate the laws of the land which ensure freedom of speech and expression to everyone\n\nThe people put in jails became target of the state as they exercised their right to free speech On the occasion of International Human Rights Day it is important that we raise our voice in their support We have fulfilled our duty by raising our voice in their favour and we will keep on doing so It will be wrong to associate this demand of ours with any religion caste colour or region\n\nBJP has resorted to the policy of divide and rule which people need to be aware of They dub anyone who raises the voice for rights of people as a traitor It is their tested formula to defame peoples voices as seditious or insinuate that they are coloured by a specific religion or ideology They dub dissenting voices as Naxalites or Pakistan sponsored terrorists We should be conscious about the troll armies managed by their partys IT cell\n\nTheir advice to us that we remain confined to farmers issues is flawed The demand for the release of intellectuals is integral to peoples struggles They have been arrested to erode intellectual support of peoples struggles The state wants people to remain confined to their narrow identities and narrow interests so that no one resists people being subjected to repression and torture\n\nThe state finds it easy to control people when they are divided It is important to build solidarities around people who are the target of sectarian and communal state policies We are of the opinion that pursing narrow interests and keeping aloof from the wider democraticminded community will weaken our struggle rather than strengthening it\n\nLet us unite our struggle with the voices of all people victimised by the state\n\n State Committee BKU EktaUgrahan"

			"Language" : "en",
			"Summary" : "Not all the state associations seem to be happy with the venues chosen for Englands upcoming tour of India and some aggrieved cricket administrators in the state associations are linking it to this months elections of the Indian cricket board Even Indian cricket board president Sourav Gangulys home state Bengal has questioned him on why it wasnt allotted any of the 12 matches that will be played in FebruaryMarch\n\nA shocked Mumbai said it was extremely unexpected at being ignored completely On the other hand Gujarat Cricket Association GCA will host seven of the 12 matches in Ahmedabad\n\nPune a very surprising choice will host all three Oneday Internationals while Chennai  Tamil Nadu Cricket Associations president Rupa Meiyappan is the daughter of former BCCI Board of Control for Cricket in India chief N Srinivasan  will host two of the four Tests The other two Tests will be staged in Ahmedabad along with all the five T20 Internationals The GCA which will host a an unprecedented seven matches is the home association of BCCI secretary Jay Shah though he doesnt hold any position in it now\n\nThe Mumbai Cricket Association MCA is the other affiliate of the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI that is shocked to find the city being ignored for the February 5March 28 tour of England especially as no Test has been staged in the city for four years\n\nInterestingly Ganguly had hinted on September 28 that Mumbai and Kolkata could host the England matches though at the time there were still some doubts about the tour materialising due to the Covid pandemic But it was certain that if the tour went ahead matches would be played in a biosecure bubble either in India or in the United Arab Emirates UAE as the BCCI has signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU with the Emirates Cricket Board ECB for cooperation\n\nWhile Cricket Association Bengal CAB president Avishek Dalmiya said he has asked Ganguly directly MCA executive committee member Nadeem Memon speaking on behalf of panel colleagues has requested MCA president Vijay Patil to let them know the reasons for Mumbai not getting a single match\n\nMemon also referred to Gangulys comments on September 28 Ganguly a former CAB president had made those comments soon after signing the MoU with the ECB\n\nWe also have the same facility biosecure bubble in Mumbai  Cricket Club of India Brabourne Stadium Wankhede Stadium and DY Patil Stadium We also have Eden Gardens Kolkata We have to create a bubble We want to hold our cricket in India thats where the game is thats where the heart is Ganguly had said Now there is heartburn in certain pockets of the country\n\nDalmiya son of late Jagmohan Dalmiya and a friend of Ganguly told him that CAB was expecting to hold a match in Kolkata\n\nCAB was expecting a match against England especially since the last ODI match which was scheduled to be played in Kolkata got cancelled said Dalmiya in a statement referring to the ODI against South Africa in March that was cancelled to Covid\n\nIn this context I did have a word with the BCCI president Mr Sourav Ganguly and enquired if Kolkata could be accommodated to which Mr Ganguly informed that these are unprecedented times and that BCCI had to settle with a maximum of three venues this time due to ongoing pandemic he said\n\nDalmiya said that Ganguly has assured me that CAB would get a turn in the next home series\n\nIndia is scheduled to host ODIs and T20s against South Africa as well as T20 matches against New Zealand as per the revised Future Tour Programme postCovid ahead of ICC World T20 in 2021 in India he said\n\nMemon pointed out that Mumbai last hosted a Test match four years ago against England\n\nMumbai has three of the best stadiums in the world with the best hotel facilities and other services Also Mumbai has been recovering well from all Covid19 related crisis Mumbai has not hosted a Test Match since 2016 he said in his letter sent to MCA president Vijay Patil\n\nIt is shocking and extremely unexpected that the BCCI wouldnt consider Mumbai for the upcoming series despite BCCI president Mr Sourav Ganguly himself saying that BCCI will keep the matches in Mumbai in the future he wrote\n\nWe the Apex Council members of the MCA urge you to write to the BCCI president regarding our concern and we want to know the reasons behind them not considering any of the Mumbai stadiums\n\nBesides Dalmiya and Memon several other people linked the choice of Pune  the headquarters of the controversial Maharashtra Cricket Association MCA  to the BCCI elections that would take place on December 24 during the AGM\n\nWhile pointing out that each vote is priceless in a BCCI election an official referred to the crucial financial issues that MCA is in also visavis its International Stadium in Gahunje on the outskirts of Pune where the three ODIs against England will be played\n\nThe equation is very simple MCA has two big financial payments to make and for that it badly and urgently needs money One large payment is due to Shapoorji Pallonji  Co Ltd who constructed the Gahunje stadium and the other is due to Bank of Maharashtra and Andhra Bank from which it has taken a big loans besides Bank of Baroda and Karnataka Bank he said\n\nBy hosting three matches against England MCA would earn a handsome amount from the instadia advertising rights and other sources Also the BCCI gives more than Rs1 crore for an association to host an international match In return the MCA can oblige a certain person or persons at the elections if it comes to voting he explained\n\nThe BCCI pays Rs25 crore to the association for hosting a Test match Rs15 crore for staging an ODI and Rs15 crore for hosting a T20 International\n\nThe financial situation in MCA is so bad that the BCCI has been paying the loan to the banks on behalf of the MCA In August alone the BCCI made a direct payment of Rs591 crore to Bank of Maharashtra and Andhra Bank as reimbursement of old Infrastructure claim of MCA stadium project besides Rs597 crore to MCA as reimbursement of old infrastructure claim of MCA stadium project according to the BCCI website\n\nIANS\n\nqmarkm"

Praveen Tripathi DIG Presidency Range and Rajeev Mishra ADG South Bengal  were responsible for the security of the BJP chief during his December 910 visit to the politically volatile state that will

the state concerned to release officers of the All India Services for central deputation while keeping in mind their availability\n\nIAS and IPS officers are governed by Article 312 of the

option Thats the procedure he said\n\nThe Home Ministrys move for shifting the three IPS officers may further embitter the relations between the Centre and the Mamata Banerjee government\n\nSources in

unilaterally and bypassing the West Bengal government they said in usual circumstances the consent of the state government concerned is obtained\n\nThese three officers are perceived to be close to

			"Summary" : "Birthday Postscript\n\nBoth Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar have their birthdays in December While Sonias was a low key celebration Pawars 80th birthday saw half page advertisements in the national dailies felicitating his political journey Interestingly in the essay that accompanies the greetings Praful Patel recounts the many times Pawar nearly became Prime Minister beginning with 1991 when Narasimha Rao was propped up over Pawars candidature and later in 1996 when the Congress won 145 MPs the United Front leaders such as Deve Gowda Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Yadav had agreed to support a Congress government under Pawars prime ministership but Narasimha Rao didnt flinch Later when the Gowda government was brought down by Sitaram Kesri this plan was revived again but didnt get Kesris backing Praful Patel also talks about how later when Sharad Pawar was the Congress parliamentary party leader his decisions were overrun by PJ Kurien at the promptings of Sonia Gandhi And so on Its interesting that this narrative has come to light at a time when the Congress is looking for a credible leadership to replace Sonia Gandhi and is also for the first time questioning the hold of the dynasty In fact the timing of Pranab Mukherjees memoirs where he rues the fact that he was kept from becoming Prime Minister by the Gandhi family is also interesting Will the Congress look to the past to make decisions about the future\n\nPawar Games\n\nLast week saw the revival of an old story when the political rumour mill claimed that Sharad Pawar would replace Sonia Gandhi as the UPA chairperson Certainly with Sonia Gandhi taking a step back Pawar is the tallest leader in the UPA But the NCP is not the largest party and Pawar is well aware of this limitation However there is a certain disquiet amongst the UPA partners as to who will lead the opposition alliance against the BJP Rahul Gandhi doesnt seem to carry much clout not as leader of the Congress and also not as a reliable ally Its not just the partys drubbing in Bihar that pulled down the alliance but Akhilesh Yadav also blames his alliance with the Congress for sabotaging his chances in the 2017 UP polls Mamata Bannerjee is not keen to tie up with the Congress in West Bengal and it remains to be seen what kind of a bargain the DMK will strike with the Congress for the Tamil Nadu polls Interestingly it was Pawar who recently spoke to Rahuls lack of consistency And therefore while the Congress and even the NCP has denied the rumours that Pawar will replace Sonia as the UPA chairperson it hasnt scotched the speculation For as the Shiv Senas Sanjay Raut said on the subject Politics is unpredictable You never know what will happen next While Congress leaders claim that the role of chairperson should be given to a member of the largest party in the coalition they forget two things One that the UPA is not a formal organisation with a hard and fast Constitution but a loose coalition of likeminded parties Second as Rasheed Kidwai author and political commentator points out when the National Front was formed the chairmanship went to NT Ramarao even though the TDP was not the largest party the Janata Party was The real question remains did the NCP overplay its hand by going public with its plans\n\nThe Himalayan Challenge\n\nDr Subramanian Swamys book Himalayan Challenge India China and the Quest for Peace is now out Dr Swamys link with China goes way back and was one of the reasons why he was invited to China in 1981 by then Chairman Deng Xiaoping At the end of a 100minute meeting he persuaded the Chinese to open the Kailash Mansarovar route for Hindu pilgrims This meeting is part of the annexures of Swamys book as are extracts from a Soviet document dated 2nd October 1959 which Swamy accessed from the Woodrow Wilson Cold War Archives while at Harvard The document records a meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong where both Nehru and Tibet come up for discussion between the two leaders But what is interesting is that through this book Swamy takes a look at Indias China policy over the years from Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi Few know this but Swamy is also fluent in Mandarin a language he took up as a challenge from his wife Roxna In fact during a NewsX interview when asked to speak in Mandarin he quoted a Chinese proverb which goes like thisbeware of the foreigner who speaks Chinese as its such a difficult language that those who take the trouble of learning it would definitely have some agenda for doing so As for Swamys agenda he is hopeful for a long term relationship between the two countries which share a common Asian mindset but for now he is of the firm view that we should push back the Chinese from our territory and not be misled by them as we were in 1962\n\nBungalow Politics\n\nThe late Ahmed Patels family has been given a notice by the Rajya Sabha Housing Committee to vacate his bungalow in Delhi albeit with a grace period of six months which the family is grateful for Congress workers all recall Ahmed Bhais house at Mother Teresa Crescent as a house with many doors for despite a waiting room full of visitors you never knew who was entering or exiting the place What Congress leaders however are asking is whether the late Ram Vilas Paswans family too has been served a similar notice Or could it be that Narendra Modis ministerial reshuffle might accommodate Chirag Paswan in more ways than one\n\nWhat next for Kamal Nath\n\nAhmed Patel leaves behind many a vacancy Not just as party treasurer but more importantly what the party will miss is his role as a trouble shooter While Rahul Gandhi would like to prop up someone from his own team there are some who believe that none of them has the expertise and experience of a candidate from the Old Guard\n\nAshok Gehlots name is doing the rounds but the Rajasthan Chief Minister has made it clear that he would rather stay on in the state There is however another ex CM who is out of job and may fit the role of a trouble shooter Kamal Nath for he has a good equation with almost all the UPA alliesfrom Pawar to the DMK as well as others such as Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati In fact as general secretary of the party Nath has handled several crucial states including West Bengal Assam and Tamil Nadu all three which are slated to go to the polls next year In fact the evergreen networker has kept a channel open with all the factions of the party and not just the Old Guard\n\nFor instance Nath was in Jaipur recently for a wedding and while one is not sure whether he met Gehlot it was Sachin Pilot who came to see him off at the airport So Nath may have the right credentials for the job there is also an opening in his CV that coincides with a vacancy at the party headquarters But will he get the job The answer to this question is not with Sonia Gandhi but with Rahul"

			"PublishDate" : "2020-12-12 22:44:45.000000",
			"Language" : "en",
			"Summary" : "The eightlane expressway to connect Chennai with Salem has its detractors among farmers While the government argues that it will reduce travel time and is essential for the development of the region farmers are certain they do not want to lose their precious land to the project After the recent Supreme Court ruling protests have been resurrected\n\nWhile the Supreme Courts December 8 ruling allows the National Highways Authority of India NHAI to acquire land for the proposed 10000crore expressway to connect Salem with Chennai the affected farmers are now pinning their hopes on the project failing to get environmental clearance Unwilling to part with their land farmers want the State government to put pressure on the Centre to drop the project\n\nThe ruling overturned the Madras High Courts April 2019 verdict that quashed the land acquisition notification The High Court had said the acquisition process was undertaken in haste And the project became a significant point in the manifesto for the western region during the 2019 Lok Sabha election The State government has been maintaining that the benefits are many and the expressway will cut travel time by several hours besides leading to the development of the region Parties rallied around the farmers who were opposed to the project and took on the ruling AIADMK that was keen on implementing it\n\nPublic consultations soon\n\nWelcoming the Supreme Court order NHAI officials say they have received the terms of reference for the project and two studies have been done Public consultations will be held soon according to the rules First we will approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board which will be responsible for its conduct Then we will have to take time to seek objections and then award and disburse the amount due says an official Former officials however say the project will be delayed by at least 30 months thus driving up the cost\n\nPoll plank\n\nThe Supreme Courts ruling comes at a time when parties gear up for the 2021 Assembly election and they may look at the possibility of using the project as a plank in the region A Chandramohan State coordinator of the All India Kisan Sabha says farmers are firm in opposing the project The governments at the Centre and in the State will have to risk an electoral setback if they decide to go ahead with the project he warns Parties that have been opposing the project should flag it as a major issue in their manifestos he says\n\nThe High Court had found the process vitiated by the charges of police highhandedness against protesters and submission of a detailed project report with plagiarised content by the project consultant among others The Supreme Court however declared that the competence of the consultant was not challenged by the petitioners and was not enough cause to set aside the land acquisition notification\n\nThe Supreme Court also upheld the legislative competence of the Central government to declare any land a highway under the Land Acquisition Act 1956 something that was upheld by the High Court too when the petitioners argued that it was the State legislature that was the competent authority to do so The Supreme Court also held that it was not ultra vires the Constitution pointing out that the Constitution gives powers and legislative competence to Parliament\n\nThe High Court had questioned the reasons for the sudden change in the sections  from the ChennaiMadurai stretch that was originally conceived under the Bharatmala Pariyojana to a greenfield corridor between Chennai and Salem through Krishnagiri  without the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs But it had stopped short of declaring it mala fide Though the High Court acknowledged that courts should not intervene in policy matters it however questioned the utility of the project It flagged questions over food security as a consequence of diversion of vast tracts of agricultural land and alluded to the judgments from US courts\n\nEC only before construction\n\nThe Supreme Court however rested its ruling on the technical and scientific expertise of the expert committees of the NHAI which is an arm of the Union Ministry that took the decision to change the section The court thereby implied that a judicial review of a policy decision would be unwarranted Further it accepted the Centres argument that the length of the ChennaiKrishnagiriSalem corridor was less than the ChennaiMadurai corridor and it would not entail any additional cost\n\nThe Supreme Court also held that environmental clearance was not mandatory for the notification and it was mandatory only before undertaking construction or implementation of the project According to the court it was not necessary for the the Central governmentthe NHAI to apply for prior environmentalforest clearances or permissions at the stage of planning or taking an inprinciple decision to formalise the project for constructing a greenfield highway Such clearances can happen only after the land is vested with the government once after the notification is made under Section 3 D of the Land Acquisition Act 1956 and not prior to the notification under Section 3 A which is a declaration of intent to acquire land for a public purpose\n\nThe verdict also foreclosed the scope of the competent authorities under the environmental lawforest law stating that their power was limited to scrutiny of a formalised project brought up by an executing agency for ascertaining the environmental impact and imposition of remedial conditions\n\nDrawing a comparison between a highway and an industrial project spread over a vast expanse of area the court believed that the former only gave a way of passage without much disturbance while the latter had an impact on the local population owing to the continuous commercialindustrial activity Therefore according to the court environmental impact would have to be measured in relative terms at the local level and sitespecific Whereas the requirement for a roadnational highway was in the larger national interest rendering environmental clearances perfunctory\n\nWe will not give up our lands\n\nThat being the position landowners want the Centre to drop the project believing that nothing else will bring respite to them Farmers will not give land for the project says R Mohanasundaram a farmer from Pullavari in Salem who claims he will lose six acres to the project It will not get environmental clearance if the assessment is made in a transparent manner he says The Supreme Courts judgment has more or less retained the positive elements of the judgment passed by the Madras High Court It has permitted the Centre to go ahead with the project only after following due procedures he points out\n\nEnvironmental risks\n\nThe State government should now put pressure on the Centre and make it drop the project The project involves destruction of several acres of forests agricultural lands and several waterbodies says Mr Mohanasundaram Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswamis claims about the project are not true If he is a farmer as he claims he should stop the progress of the project at any cost\n\nAccording to official sources nearly 36 km of the project passes through Salem district\n\nJ Pannerselvam of Koolampatti in Salem district says he will lose three acres We are not against development Farmers are only questioning the need for this project when there are already three roads connecting Chennai with Salem besides the rail and air connectivity The road is being laid only to favour corporates Our only demand now is that the governments should drop the project that will affect farmers in 18 villages he adds\n\nThe land acquired for the UlundurpetChennai Highway has space for expansion he says adding that expansion of the existing roads will be sufficient to facilitate freight movement\n\nM Kavitha a farmer from Ayodhiyapattinam who would lose 75 acres wants the government to drop the project We will continue with our protests till the government decides to scrap the project she says\n\nTalk to farmers MP\n\nDMK MP from Salem SR Parthibhan wants the government to hold discussions with farmers instead of taking away their land and depriving them of their livelihood The party will raise the issue during elections and demand that the government drop the project he says DMK MP from Dharmapuri Senthilkumar says his party will scrap the project when it returns to power I am meeting with the farmers on December 16 at Paapireddypatty to hold consultations with them he says\n\nMeanwhile farmers have resolved to stage a blockade of the Collectorate in Dharmapuri on December 28 and observe Pongal as a day of mourning They have also planned a blockade of the State Assembly during the Budget Session in February next year\n\nWith inputs from Vignesh Vijayakumar in Salem and Deepa H Ramakrishnan in Chennai"

Bharat is an example of the countrys faith in its private sector he said\n\nThe Prime Minister said that in life as well as governance a confident person never hesitates in giving space to others A strong government backed by massive mandate exudes that confidence and dedication A decisive government always strives to remove obstacles for others and always tries to contribute towards the society and the nation Such a government doesnt want to hog the control and initiative He recalled the time when government was in all the sectors and described the ruin brought about this approach on the economy A visionary and decisive government on the other hand encourages all the stakeholders to realize their potential Shri Modi pointed out that in the last six years the government is encouraging stakeholders in all sector This is reflected in the allround reforms in sectors ranging from manufacturing to MSME agriculture to infrastructure from tech industry to taxation and from real estate to regulatory easing he added\n\nThe Prime Minister told the gathering that our industry needs bridges not walls By removing the walls separating various sectors of the economy there will be new opportunities for everyone especially the farmers who will get new options Investment in technology cold storage and the agrisector will benefit farmers The Prime Minister called for investing energy

Nicobar Islands on 29th November It caused widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places  extremely heavy  20 cm falls at isolated places occurred over Tamil Nadu during 02nd  04th December\n\nA preliminary analysis indicate that due the prevailing middle to upper tropospheric environment with a COL region due to two anticyclones on either side to northeast and northwest of the cyclone over Gulf of Mannar the system remained practically stationary for about 36 hrs Further persistence over this landlocked region of Gulf of Mannar led to cooling of Gulf of Mannar through continuous rainfall and upwelling over the region and hence cooling of the sea region Further the increased wind shear and interaction of land surface favoured the weakening\n\nMonitoring of the
