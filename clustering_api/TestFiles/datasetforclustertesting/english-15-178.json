			"PublishDate" : "2020-12-15 03:21:55.000000",
			"Language" : "en",
			"Summary" : "Note This story was first published on March 28 2017 and was republished on December 15 2020\n\nHalf a planet away from the immediacy of politics that dominates our headlines theres a crisis unfolding that can dog us for centuries In West Antarctica a huge ice shelf called Larsen C has developed a rift 175 kilometres long and halfakilometre wide A chunk of the shelf is poised to break off soon When that happens the chunk will be an iceberg over 5000 sq km across and 350m high  more than four times the height of Delhis Qutub Minar and over an area oneandahalf times the size of Goa And we need to pay more attention because it could potentially gravely impact Indias people in the near and long term\n\nIce shelves are extensions of ice sheets are fed by their glaciers and jut hundreds of kilometres out to sea Sprawled over 48600 sq km Larsen C is a little larger than Haryana It is Antarcticas fourthlargest ice shelf and an extension of the gigantic West Antarctic Ice Sheet WAIS The rift in Larsen C has been growing in recent weeks by several kilometres at a time\n\nThe mammoth icebergtobe  lets call it Goa Plus  is currently attached to Larsen C by 20 kilometres of ice It could break off entirely anytime in the next few months weakening the ice shelf further This happened to its nowextinct cousin Larsen B In 1995 a large chunk of Larsen B broke off and B itself disintegrated spectacularly over a 35day period in 2002\n\nPeerreviewed research has yet to conclusively demonstrate that global warming is responsible for the accelerating rift in Larsen C although background warming conditions have made that likely Temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula where Larsen C is located have been rising at four to six times the global average according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Fifth Assessment Report 5AR Global warming also traps warmer subsurface ocean waters because of which climate change has caused a thinning of the Larsen C ice shelf the team studying it said last month\n\nBut Larsen Cs disintegration will not occur next week In a mental landscape increasingly dominated by mobile phones tweets and the ephemeral nature of Breaking News whats happening to Larsen C illustrates a key trait about global warming that will take some effort to get our heads around Many of its slower effects unfold over long periods After the chunk broke off Larsen B in 1995 it kept getting smaller eventually disintegrating only seven years later\n\nAdrian Luckman a professor of glaciology at the Swansea University Wales and project leader of the group studying Larsen C wrote this author an email recently If the shelf continues to erode slowly after this calving event  as was the case with Larsen B  then it will be years until the remaining shelf is eroded far enough for a complete destabilisation\n\nAccelerating sea level rise\n\nThe vast WAIS Klaus Doddss The Antarctic informs us is marinebased its base is below sea level Its edges transform into floating ice shelves So Larsen Cs collapse will not by itself contribute to sea level rise as it is already floating in water But the glaciers that feed into Larsen C can because when an ice shelf gives way these glaciers start to flow much faster into the sea\n\nThe collapse of Larsen B which is unprecedented in the last 10000 years has resulted in a speeding up of the tributary glaciers by 300 to 800 says the 5AR Thats not good news Larsen C is five times as large as Larsen B was The glaciers it holds back contain vastly more ice and as has been reported could contribute a sealevel rise of 10 cm\n\nAnd all this is part of an accelerating rise that may have already begun Per the IPCC the average rate of ice loss from Antarctica has increased from 30 billion tonnes a year over 19922001 to 147 billion tonnes a year over 20022011 Twentieth century sea level rise was linear increasing in fixed steps because its chief sources were ocean expansion due to warmer waters and glacial melting It will happen at an exponentially growing rate this century because the main source will be the melting of and faster ice flows from the gigantic ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica\n\nIn a paper published last March the renowned climate scientist James Hansen and others foresee a nonlinearly growing sea level rise reaching several metres over a timescale of 50150 years\n\nImplications for India\n\nTen centimetres of average sea level rise from the collapse of Larsen C may not seem like much until we put that figure in perspective Its a little over half of all the sea level rise the world has already experienced since 1901 This should deeply concern us Sea level rise in the Sunderbans is significantly higher than the global average thanks to its topography and that its land is subsiding When a team this author was part of visited some islands in the Sunderbans a couple years ago we spoke to numerous people whose earliest homes had since been swallowed under water It was easy to meet people who had moved three or four times due to advancing erosion There were also fragmented families living around agricultural lands and water sources that had turned saline and farmers being forced to migrate in the thousands\n\nErosion and sea ingress are also happening on the coasts of Gujarat Tamil Nadu and elsewhere But an accelerating sea level rise will means that what is happening in Sunderbans today will occur all along Indias 7500km coastline tomorrow  with the potential to devastate coastal communities The lives of millions of people will surely get affected by events that seem very distant\n\nLarsen B disintegrated in 2002 A 570sqkm chunk of the Wilkins ice shelf broke off in 2008 The 5000sqkm Goa Plus will break off Larsen C in 2017 These are early warning signs to which we should pay heed These dramatic events provide much food for thought They are for all practical purposes irreversible and no one expects Larsen B to reform in the foreseeable future and hold its glaciers in check once again\n\nWe also need to internalise the longterm nature of the changes that are being wrought such as ice sheet destabilisation in Antarctica and elsewhere Individually and collectively humans have become used to providing for our old age and thinking about the wellbeing of our next generation  but not beyond Now we need to reconsider how we think about global warming and its impact which will continue to haunt many generations in India and around the world for centuries to come\n\nNagraj Adves booklet Global Warming in

Tests New Zealands Mitchell Santner leftarm 31 and Mark Craig offspinner 37 shared just three wickets while Pakistans Yasir Shah returned 0197 last year Fellow legspinner Tabraiz Shamsi of South Africa averaged 75 2150 Englands Moeen Ali didnt take a wicket 293990\n\nAlso Read  If I was a selector Id pick him Border Gavaskar pick Indias openers\n\nWhile Lyon is certain to play Ashwin has a modest overseas record And but for Ravindra Jadejas injury he would have to also contend with the latters better batting and electric fielding Hanuma Viharis parttime offspin too can tempt India to pick an extra seamer Ashwins challenge is clear\n\nStill the LyonAshwin rivalry is certain to emerge as the series unfolds The career of Lyon 32 has run parallel to Ashwins Their overall hauls are not far apart though Lyon has an advantage Flatter pitches and a kookaburra ball not great to grip are at his home turf Friendly subcontinent conditions are a bonus\n\nThere is little to separate in terms of overall numbers Lyon has 390 wickets in 96 Tests while Ashwin has a tally of 365 in 71 Lyon though has 191 scalps in 48 home Tests including 51 in 11 versus India\n\nAshwins early coach is confident he will have plans in place if picked for Adelaide On the 2018 England Test series at a seaming Edgbaston Ashwin bowled Alastair Cook cheaply in both innings This time Steve Smith a righthander unlike the retiring Cook looms as a far bigger threat\n\nAlso Read  Warne says he would pick Kuldeep ahead of Ashwin in Adelaide Test\n\nI want him to surprise the pundits surprise billions of others by getting a matchwinning spell says Sunil Subramaniam a former Tamil Nadu leftarm spinner who first noticed Ashwin at a state coaching camp and guided him\n\nDoing well in Adelaide will be crucial for Ashwin when Jadeja regains fitness But in seven Tests in Australia he has 27 wickets at an average of 4807 and a strike rate of 9478 For his 254 wickets at home he only has 111 away\n\nShivlal Yadav who was Indias main offspinner on the 198182 and 198586 tours of Australia says the key is to adapt\n\nTo succeed in Australia the basic thing is to flight the ball Flight and impart finger spin and you will get the same amount of help from the pitch The faster you bowl easier it is for the batsmen That is why S Venkatraghavan was not that successful in Australia while EAS Prasanna 31 wickets in 8 Tests always was and I did reasonably well said Yadav who took 23 wickets in five Tests in Australia\n\nAshwin was in good rhythm in IPL though a shoulder injury forced him to sit out some games Besides he has not always been the first choice In 201415 debutant legspinner Karn Sharma was chosen over him for the first Test After an indifferent show in the loss Ashwin was recalled and took 12 wickets at 4866 in three matches\n\nI dont think being inform or outofform would have a say in how he performs He can draw upon his experience intelligence The only thing would be injury as he has had them on recent tours said Subramaniam\n\nLyon is a more classical offspinnersideon semiopen and uses his body fully So he extracts more out of wickets that doesnt assist Ashwin is a fingerandhands bowler He is not much of a body bowler He makes up with his cerebral approach He uses the angle of delivery and the crease Both intrigue me If you are a connoisseur of spin bowling you would love to watch them go headtohead\n\nAccording to CricViz data Lyon imparts more spin on the ball His average deviation is 418 degrees to Ashwins 313 Lyon bowls fuller and probes outside offstump Ashwin prefers to attack the stumps middleandleg\n\nLyon is a brilliant spinner who has proved himself all over the world be it South Africa or India His action is so smooth that even if he bowls long spells he doesnt lack penetration says Yadav\n\nAt home Lyon exploits the bounce and aims for batpad catches With Virat Kohli flying home after the first Test his main challenge will be how he bowls to Cheteshwar Pujara The star of Indias 201819 campaign negated Lyon with two tacticsusing the feet to kill the turn and the pad to avoid batpad chances In 11 innings Lyon has dismissed Pujara four times His average against Pujara is 61 Lyon has a good record against vicecaptain Ajinkya Rahane removing him six times in 14 innings at an average of 3216\n\nCricViz statistics also show the Aussie bowls wider more often while extracting more turn with the kookaburra ball that does not have a pronounced seam like Indias SG make While 217 of Lyons deliveries are pitched wide only 114 of Ashwins deliveries adopt that line Just over 50 of their deliveries are on the offstump channel\n\nNumbers also show that Lyon pitches full more often 362 to 300 while Ashwin bowls a touch slower 866 kph to 874 kph\n\nSMITH CHALLENGE\n\nThe other side of the battle will be how Ashwin goes against Smith In an ominous sign for India Smith has run into great form in the ODIs His record against the Indian bowling is intimidating and the Australia No 3 has dominated Ashwin In the 14 innings they have faced off Smith has got out to him only thrice and he averages 116 348 runs off 570 balls against him\n\nThis week Ashwin was nominated for the International Cricket Council ICC Mens Player of the Decade award in a sevenplayer list He is the fastest Indian bowler to reach 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 wickets in terms of innings\n\nFor such a prolific performer making a mark overseas is yet to happen\n\nIf you look at the wickets we have played on for the last year or so the spinners role outside India is to hold one end up and contribute with the bat Jadeja has been doing that beautifully Ashwin I suspect would play the same role They cant do more than what traditional finger spinners can do\n\nSign on to read the HT ePaper epaperhindustantimescom"

			"Summary" : "The Maruti 800 is an icon in every sense and holds a special place in Indias automotive history The model was a gamechanger that brought the era of Japanese fourwheeled mobility to the masses in the country On December 14 2020 the Maruti 800 celebrates its 37th anniversary and while it may not be on sale anymore the car continues to be deeply a part of our collective conscience not to forget its still not too hard to spot one on the road As we celebrate 37 years of the iconic 800 here are seven facts that you need to know about Indias Peoples Car\n\nAlso Read The Iconic Maruti 800 Turns 35\n\nThe Maruti 800 was technologically advanced than its rivals at the time and also Indias first frontwheeldrive car\n\n1 The Maruti 800 was Indias first frontwheeldrive car\n\nThe very firstgeneration Maruti 800 was a big deal and a major departure from the popular Premier Padmini and the Hindustan Ambassador that were the more accessible cars available in 1983 It was also the first vehicle to get a frontwheeldrive setup in the country and was also more technologically advanced than its rivals at the time The Maruti 800 aimed to bridge the gap between the old and new bringing in far better reliability and a more frugal engine as well Maruti claimed fuel efficiency of 2595 kmpl on the 800 at the time of launch in 1983 T\n\nThe Maruti 800 SS80 was based on the Suzuki Fronte while the secondgen Alto based bodyshell was introduced in 1986\n\n2 The Maruti 800 started life as the Suzuki Fronte SS80\n\nThe original 800 was based on the Suzuki Fronte SS80 which was also the codename for the model in India A more modernised version with an aerodynamic bodyshell of the secondgeneration Alto SB308 was introduced in 1986 The first batch of the 800 was imported as a Completely Knocked Down CKD kit while the model was completely localised and built here for domestic and export markets\n\n3 The first Maruti 800 was priced at  47500\n\nThe Maruti 800 was pitched as the Peoples Car for India and was introduced at an accessible price of  47500 exshowroom A more premium variant with airconditioning was introduced in 1984 that was priced around  70000 About 15 per cent of the total cars produced were converted into the Deluxe variant with the HVAC unit In contrast the Ambassador and Padmini both were priced around  70000 exshowroom mark The aggressive pricing and easy ownership costs also made Indias middleclass sit up and take notice and flock to showrooms However purchasing an 800 wasnt as easy as it seemed\n\nThe then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi had handed over the keys to Harpal Singh the very first owner of the Maruti 800 in the country\n\n4 The waiting period stretched for years\n\nUnlike the easy accessibility today that we have for buying cars you couldnt just drive a Maruti 800 out of a showroom back in the 19801990s At the time of its announcement about 12 lakh people booked the car for a token amount of  10000 The initial models were allotted to customers based on a lottery system and the waiting period stretched by months and sometimes years together before you were finally handed over one Customers were willing to pay extra to get an allotment In fact the first car was awarded to Harpal Singh and the keys were famously handed over to the owner by Indias Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the time Interestingly Mr Singh owned the car throughout his lifetime\n\nAlso Read Indias First Maruti 800 Should Be A National Treasure Says Owners Family\n\nThe original Maruti 800 SS80 left with its successor the SB308\n\n5 Over 27 million Maruti 800s were sold in its lifetime\n\nThe firstgen 800 was codenamed the SS80 and was built with an initial investment of  269 crore The Maruti Udyog facility had assembled about 70 cars at the time of launch and could roll out one car in 800 minutes The plant had a production capacity of 20000 cars by 1984 which further increased to 40000 units by 1988 In just two years of the Maruti 800s launch the Indian passenger car market doubled in volumes from 40000 cars sold in a year to about 1 lakh units sold per annum By 1997 eight out of ten topselling cars in India was a Maruti\n\nMaruti 800 remains a pop culture icon and was the defacto first car for an entire generation\n\n6 Was sold in West Europe as a Maruti to bypass quota for Japanese cars\n\nMaruti began exports of the 800 in 1987 and the first set of cars were shipped to neighbouring countries followed by a batch of 500 cars to Hungary The Indiamade car was later introduced in the then Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia followed by other European markets soon after After tasting success in these markets Maruti decided to go for the more developed markets like France and the Netherlands in 1989 and 1990 respectively followed by England Italy and Malta In fact the cars sold here were specifically badged as Maruti to bypass the quota limit levied on Japanese cars All badges and references to Suzuki were removed right down to the owners manual to meet the same The Maruti 800 received seatbelts for the first time in 1987 to meet the export requirements and also the companys first catalytic converter to comply with European emission norms\n\nAlso Read From the Maruti 800 to the BMW i8 A Journey Of Auto Passion For Sachin Tendulkar\n\nA Firebrick Red Maruti 800 rolled out after final checks on January 18th 2014 after 31 years of production while sales stopped in February that year\n\n7 Maruti pulled the plug on the 800 in February 2014\n\nBy 2014 Maruti Suzuki was an auto giant and leader in the worlds thirdlargest auto market It had gone far beyond selling the 800 Meanwhile the Maruti 800 was finding it difficult to keep up with changing customer preferences That along with low volumes and the upgrade to BS4 emission regulations meant that meant we finally saw the automaker pull the plug on the muchloved product The final Maruti 800 rolled off the assembly line in February 2014 for a customer in Chandigarh bringing an end to a glorious era in Indian automobile history\n\nFor the latest auto news and reviews follow carandbikecom on Twitter Facebook and subscribe

			"Language" : "en",
			"Summary" : "NEW DELHI AP  With Americans Britons and Canadians rolling up their sleeves to receive coronavirus vaccines the route out of the pandemic now seems clear to many in the West even if the rollout will take many months But for poorer countries the road will be far longer and rougher\n\nThe ambitious initiative known as COVAX created to ensure the entire world has access to COVID19 vaccines has secured only a fraction of the 2 billion doses it hopes to buy over the next year has yet to confirm any actual deals to ship out vaccines and is short on cash\n\nThe virus that has killed more than 16 million people has exposed vast inequities between countries as fragile health systems and smaller economies were often hit harder COVAX was set up by the World Health Organization vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI a global coalition to fight epidemics to avoid the international stampede for vaccines that has accompanied past outbreaks and would reinforce those imbalances\n\nBut now some experts say the chances that coronavirus shots will be shared fairly between rich nations and the rest are fading fast With vaccine supplies currently limited developed countries some of which helped fund the research with taxpayer money are under tremendous pressure to protect their own populations and are buying up shots Meanwhile some poorer countries that signed up to the initiative are looking for alternatives because of fears it wont deliver\n\nIts simple math said Arnaud Bernaert head of global health at the World Economic Forum Of the approximately 12 billion doses the pharmaceutical industry is expected to produce next year about 9 billion shots have already been reserved by rich countries COVAX has not secured enough doses and the way the situation may unfold is they will probably only get these doses fairly late\n\nTo date COVAXs only confirmed legally binding agreement is for up to 200 million doses though that includes an option to order several times that number of additional doses GAVI spokesman James Fulker said It has agreements for another 500 million vaccines but those are not legally binding\n\nThe 200 million doses will come from the Serum Institute of India the company that will likely make a large portion of the coronavirus shots destined for the developing world CEO Adar Poonawalla says it has a confirmed order for 100 million doses each of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and one from Novovax\n\nWe dont have anything beyond that in writing he told The Associated Press If they want more theyll have to place more orders\n\nHe said the lack of commitment from COVAX will mean a much longer wait for people in developing countries Poonawalla also noted that his companys first priority would be making shots for India which has suggested it wants at least 300 million vaccines Its likely India would not be able to take all of those at once but a big order could delay the distribution of vaccines for other parts of the developing world Poonawalla said\n\nPotentially further slowing down the process is that neither the AstraZeneca vaccine nor the Novovax one has been licensed by any regulatory agency yet  and any injection distributed by COVAX will likely need WHO approval COVAX does not have any supplies of the two vaccines that appear to be most effective so far  the PfizerBioNTech shot and the Moderna one The United Kingdom has already begun giving the Pfizer vaccine and the United States and Canada are rolling it out this week Some Gulf countries have also authorized it\n\nStill GAVI said they aim to start rolling out safe and effective vaccines to COVAX member countries at scale within the first and second quarters of the New Year\n\nEven with vaccines in hand the rollouts will take many months even in rich countries and many developing ones are facing serious logistical challenges that will add to delays noted Dr Gagandeep Kang an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India\n\nEven senior officials at the WHO have acknowledged privately that attempts to fairly allocate vaccine through the initiative are flawed despite publicly lauding its success\n\nThe whole call for global solidarity has mostly been lost said Dr Katherine OBrien WHOs vaccines chief during a recent internal discussion a recording of which was obtained by the AP\n\nAsked to clarify her remarks OBrien said in an email that every country should have access to COVID19 vaccines as early as feasible\n\nAdding to COVAXs difficulties OBrien noted at a news conference this month that it was still 5 billion short to buy the doses its planning to obtain next year\n\nAccording to a report GAVI issued ahead of a meeting this week the alliance itself concluded that the risk COVAX will fail is very high saying it was established in record time and has to navigate unchartered territory\n\nBut John Nkengasong director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criticized Western countries for buying up the global vaccine supply in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX effort\n\nWith no certainty about which shots would work governments scrambled in recent months to sign multiple deals to ensure their citizens would have at least some COVID19 injections Canada for example bought nearly 200 million vaccines  enough to cover its population of 38 million about five times over\n\nNkengasong called the idea that people in rich countries would get immunized while Africans go without a moral issue\n\nBeyond the ethics experts note that failing to protect people in the developing world will leave a reservoir of coronavirus that could spark new outbreaks at any time\n\nAmid fears COVAX cant deliver some developing countries are pulling out entirely or seeking their own private deals Earlier this month the tiny Pacific island nation of Palau announced it was abandoning the initiative and would get donated vaccines from the US instead Other low and middleincome countries including Malaysia Peru and Bangladesh have stayed in the initiative but also recently inked their own deals with drugmakers as a Plan B\n\nAnban Pillay of the South African Ministry of Health said that joining COVAX was just a stopgap measure before signing bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies\n\nKate Elder vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders said its increasingly looking like the ship has sailed on equitable vaccine distribution  and GAVI WHO and others need to discuss how to increase vaccine manufacturing\n\nTo that end South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization to waive some provisions regulating intellectual property rights to make it easier for manufacturers in poor countries to make COVID19 drugs and vaccines But many rich countries are reluctant to do that\n\nAs more countries in the West authorize the vaccine the difference between people in rich countries getting vaccinated and the lack of any vaccines for the developing world will become quite stark said Anna Marriott health policy manager at Oxfam And it will only prolong the pandemic\n\nDisclaimer  This story has not been edited by The Sen Times staff and is autogenerated from news agency feeds Source Associated Press\n\nShare this

			"Summary" : "Jalpaiguri Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday accused the Centre of interfering in West Bengals jurisdiction by summoning IPS officers to serve under it and dared the union government to impose Presidents Rule in the state\n\nThe TMC supremo also lashed out at BJP for trying to convert West Bengal into riottorn Gujarat and accused the saffron party of creating a new religion of riot and hatred to serve its divisive politics\n\nReaching out to the politically crucial refugee population in the state she said they need not be afraid of the implementation of National Register of Citizens National Population Register or the Citizen Amendmengt Act as all the refugee colonies have been recognised by the West Bengal government\n\nIf BJP and the Centre think they can scare us by bringing in central forces and transferring state cadre officers they are wrong The Centre is summoning our officers Just think of it  she said at a rally here\n\nI dare the Centre to impose Presidents Rule in Bengal she added\n\nBanerjee a strident critic of the saffron party iterated that BJP national president J P Naddas convoy was not attacked in Diamond Harbour and wondered why convicted criminals were accompanying him\n\nContinuing her tirade against BJP Banerjee said No one wanted to hurt him Nadda or his convoy  Why were so many cars accompanying his convoy Why were convicted criminals accompanying him The goons who vandalised the bust of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in Kolkata last year were accompanying Nadda  People get infuriated when they see such goons roaming free\n\nTMC had dubbed as intimidatory the union home ministrys order for shifting three IPS officers from the state following the mob attack on Naddas convoy The West Bengal government will have the last word on releasing the police officers for central deputatation it had said\n\nA top West Bengal government official said on Saturday that a communication had been sent to the union home ministry conveying the states unwillingness to release the officers\n\nAiming to take the wind out of the sails of BJPs refugee outreach campaign she accused the saffron party of trying to befool them\n\nBJP is trying to befool the refugees of the state just like they had done with the people of the country before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls I want to assure everyone that no one needs to be afraid of the NRC NPR and CAA All the refugee colonies of the state have been recognised and regularised by the state cabinet All the refugees will get their land rights she said\n\nCalling the saffron party an outfit of dacoits and thieves Banerjee said the BJP to divert attention from its failures is pointing fingers at the TMC and levelling baseless allegations\n\nFor BJP everybody is a thief and they are saints The BJP is a party of dacoits and thievesit has sent dacoits from Chambal region to terrorise people of the state They are bringing in people from outside to terrorise Bengalis she said\n\nBanerjee has often called BJP a party of outsiders\n\nReferring to a recent letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on changing the national anthem Banerjee said the people of the state will give BJP a befitting reply if it goes ahead with such a misadventure\n\nThey NDA govt want to change the history of our country and now the national anthem Bengal will give a befitting reply if they try to change the national anthem she said\n\nReferring to the longpending issue of a separate Gorkhaland state Banerjee said the BJP will never provide a permanent solution to the problems of the Darjeeling hills\n\nOnly TMC can do that\n\nShe said It is good that Bimal Gurung and his followers have understood that BJP was fooling them for the last 15 years Whenever election comes it talks about Gorkhaland and Darjeeling but does nothing\n\nI had never spoken about Gorkhaland But I can assure you that only TMC can provide a permanent political solution to the problem of the hills The BJP can never do that nor is it interested in it the chief minister said\n\nIn October fugitive GJM leader Bimal Gurung had quit the BJPled NDA and joined hands with the TMC This has provided TMC with the much needed political heft in the north Bengal region where the ruling party failed to open its account in the eight Lok Sabha seats in the last parliamentary polls\n\nBJP had made deep inroads in the region and bagged seven out of the eight seats\n\nShe urged the voters of north Bengal which has 54 assembly seats spread across seven districts to give a mandate against the outsider BJP and said it is trying to destroy the state with its divisive politics\n\nHow come BJP which came from outside won all the seats What was our fault in the last ten years The RSS and BJP are trying to take control over Bengal for their vested interest They are not real Hindus They are not Ramakrishna or Vivekananda they only spread hatred the feisty TMC supremo said\n\nReaching out to the SC and ST communities of the region Banerjee said the state government has introduced schemes to provide monthly pensions to those above 60 years\n\nIn a stern message to detractors in TMC Banerjee said she will not tolerate antiparty activities and attempts to weaken ot before the assembly polls due in AprilMay 2021\n\nThose who have enjoyed all benefits for the last ten years and are now trying to weaken the party will not be tolerated she said\n\nParty heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari gave up cabinet portfolios amid speculations over him joining the BJP Forest Minister Rajib Banerjee and several other MLAs have also openly criticised a section of the partys leadership\n\nSource PTI"

			"Summary" : "KOCHI India JTA  Take a walk down this coastal citys Jew street today and youll find bustling Kasmiri storefronts selling Persian antiques pashmina shawls and traditional Islamic handicrafts  a stark contrast to the neighborhoods heyday when every household was Jewish\n\nThere are only two people left in Jew Town One very old who spends most of her time in Los Angeles and one other said Shalva Weil a senior researcher at the Seymour Fox School of Education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading figure on the Jewish communities of India\n\nOnce a vibrant community of approximately 3000 at its peak in the 1950s only a handful of elderly Jews remain here now in a city of some 677000 According to Weil there really is no community in Kochi anymore\n\nYou wont find more than five or 10 Jews she said\n\nUnlike other dwindling Jewish communities around the world the Jews of Kochi did not leave their country due to persecution or hardship Rather it was the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 that attracted many from the mostly Orthodox community to emigrate and start a new life in the Jewish homeland\n\nFor Essie Sassoon a retired doctor of obstetrics and gynecology who initially went to Israel as a medical volunteer during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 one of the main reasons to stay on was family\n\nWhen my sister and her family left for Israel I felt that I didnt have any close relations left in India I was very attached to my sister she said It was a very difficult decision because I love India very much And I was in a very good position in India and I was progressing But it happened\n\nSome of Sassoons fondest memories revolve around her childhood spent celebrating the numerous Jewish traditions and festivities as an Orthodox Cochini Jew in this southern India port city\n\nFrom the blowing of the shofar inside the now 452yearold Paradesi Synagogue on Rosh Hashanah to the annual Simchat Torah celebrations  an enormously popular threeday affair both in the narrow lanes homes and synagogues of Jew Town  holidays were celebrated with equal gusto by Kochis Jews and their nonJewish neighbors\n\nPrimely situated between Keralas stunning labyrinthine backwaters and the verdant shores of the Malabar Coast Kochi  or Cochin as it was known until 1996  has long been a crossroads of culture diversity and trade As the epicenter of the subcontinents renowned spice trade the town attracted traders from farflung locations including members of Indias oldest Jewish communities\n\nThe first Jews were believed to have arrived in the first century BC as sailors on King Solomons boats They settled in the ancient port city of Muziris now modernday Kodungallur 28 miles north of Kochi In his 2019 book One Heart Two Worlds The Story of the Jews of Kochi historian KS Mathew describes a thriving community first welcomed by then Hindu ruler King Sri Parkaran Iravi\n\nThree copper plates that date back to 1000 CE outlined 72 liberties of the tribe that would later be known as the Malabari Jews They included everything from land rights and exemption from taxes to religious freedom and special ceremonial privileges which at the time were typically awarded only to rulers\n\nIn 1341 flooding of the Periyar River led the Malabari Jews south to presentday Kochi where they built the Kochangadi Synagogue the areas first Jewish house of worship By the 16th century a second wave of Jewish emigres found refuge in Keralas surprisingly welcoming society Fleeing the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions Sephardic Jews as well as Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa came together to form the second community  the Paradesi which means foreign in Malayalam and Hindi Jews\n\nThe Jewish community bonded not only over religious practices but also through shared culinary traditions\n\nEven though there are only a few Jewish people still living in Kochi till now they observe the laws of kashrut Sassoon said\n\nIn Spice and Kosher Exotic Cuisine of the Cochin Jews a cookbook of Cochini Jewish recipes compiled by Sassoon Kenny Salem and Bala Menon ancient recipes such as Cochini pastels crispy sweet or savory pastries or the Cochin Jewish spice cake  considered by many to be the hallmark recipe of the communitys cuisine  were altered over time based on the availability of ingredients\n\nAn abundance of fresh spices coconut milk and tapioca starch in place of gelatin allowed IndoJewish households to easily adapt their strictly kosher food requirements creating a unique cuisine thats both equally Jewish and Indian in nature\n\nIn December 2018 the Paradesi Synagogue celebrated its 450th anniversary\n\nPractically every person in that community came to Cochin from all over the world  I was very honored to be the only nonCochini invited Weil recalled And it was absolutely fantastic but it was a celebration of the end of the community basically I mean everyone knew it\n\nAs a pluralistic democratic nation India has long been known as a refuge for communities facing oppression elsewhere The Paradesi and Malabari Jewish communities have always coexisted peacefully with Indians of other religions with zero traces of antiSemitism\n\nI have never felt discriminated against as a Jew living in India When I was studying at university they used to ask when the festival of the New Year that is Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  the fast  would be before they set the dates for public examinations Sassoon warmly remembers They wouldnt put exams on those dates because of Jewish students like me\n\nFor Kerala in particular the states deeply rooted syncretic multiculturalism can be traced back to antiquity when ancient traders of western Asia and India placed importance on preserving the identity of communities they traded between\n\nThe first real dent in Indias record of welcoming communities fleeing persecution came last year with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act which fasttracks citizenship to Sikh Hindu Buddhist or Jain refugees from neighboring countries but not Muslims Jews or atheists\n\nThe law is not expected to impact the few Jews who chose to remain in India\n\nThose who have immigrated to Israel are eligible for lifelong Overseas Citizen of India or OCI cards that have been easily available since 2017 thanks in part to current Prime Minister Narendra Modis close ties with Israel\n\nThis is actually the first time Im hearing about it Sassoon said when asked about the amendment I personally have an OCI card that doesnt expire I dont need a visa if I want to go to India"

			"Summary" : "It is not uncommon in India to see cattle grazing in farms and backyards ruminating by the road or even causing a minor inconvenience to vehicles Replace cattle with herds of gaur Indian bison and you are likely to be in Coonoor one of the taluks in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu\n\nIn Coonoor and the neighbouring taluk of Kotagiri gaurs come out of forests in herds and in many cases graze mate and sleep in the vast tea plantations They are soon becoming a tourist attraction in these hill stations otherwise known for the scenic landscape of emerald tea plantations interspersed with forest patches\n\nGaur Bos gaurus belongs to the family of wild oxen and is the tallest living and the second heaviest among oxen Considered the largest living bovine the body length of gaur is usually 250 cm to 360 cm with a height of 170 cm to 220 cm Males may weigh between 1000 kg to 1500 kg and females between 700 kg1000 kg\n\nIncluded in the Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 and listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List gaurs estimated population is around 13000 to 30000 in the world with approximately 85 of the population present in India In the south they are found abundantly in the WayanadMudumalaiBandipurNagarhole range A recent survey of the gaur population in the Nilgiris division of the Tamil Nadu forest department has put the population at 2000 in the division\n\nGaurs in places such as Coonoor and Kotagiri in Tamil Nadu and Kodagu in Karnataka are moving out of forests in herds to forage in farms Base map from Datawrapper\n\nGaurs leave forest make farms home\n\nThese large herbivores are being increasingly found outside protected areas Many gaurs have made farmlands of the Nilgiris district and the Kodagu district in Karnataka their home\n\nIn Kodagu where the forest is contiguous with coffee plantations they remain true to their shy nature and take to their heels at the first sign of human presence leaving trails of destruction in its wake Most of the times gaurs come into the estate at night says 55yearold coffee planter NB Krishnaraj of Nagarally village in Somwarpet taluk We rarely get to see it during the day Even if we spot one they take to their heels and sprint away They come in herds at night They mostly brush their horns against coffee shrubs and cause damage They also break the Dadap trees Erythrina subumbrans which coffee growers grow as a shade tree and eat their shoots\n\nBarring a few isolated freak accidents it is usually crop damages by gaurs that are reported from Kodagu In the Nilgiris however severe forest fragmentation has increased conflict between the gaurs and humans These conflicts mostly accidental have led to the loss of lives as well Records with the forest department Nilgiris forest division show that in the year 20182019 five human lives have been lost and 30 injuries reported from encounters with gaurs\n\nThey normally move about in the early mornings and evenings said district collector of the Nilgiris J Innocent Divya We have sensitised the local population to not venture out at these times if possible so there are no accidents Early mornings and late evenings are the time for these animals and other times are for human movement We have to do that to coexist with them\n\nA herd of gaur or the Indian bison in a tea plantation near a house in Coonoor Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nAt a 1200acre tea plantation in Coonoor the labourers claim there are at least 50 gaurs of multiple herds that have been residing in the tea estate for close to two decades The labourers who pick tea face the danger of getting too close to the gaur\n\nBut they are not scared and apply caution when needed Erumai gaurs do not do anything even if we go close to them We do our work maintaining a fair distance and they dont trouble us So I am not scared to work here said 50yearold tea picker Sivagami\n\nRecurrent crop damages caused by gaurs however infuriates some farmers but elephants leopards and bears cause much more damage to crops and lives District Forest Officer Nilgiris Division Guruswamy Dabbala says that human settlements are expanding in the district and so is the population of gaurs\n\nThey are now so habituated to human presence that they even walk into towns and markets he said They relish certain crops like beetroot which is proving to be a problem for farmers Casualties have happened and it is mostly the elderly women and labourers who find themselves in harms way\n\nA mosaic of farmlands and forests in Coorg Karnataka Fragmentation of habitats has been pushing the gaur into humandominated areas Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nGaurs are adaptable\n\nExtremely shy in nature it is in fact difficult to get close to a gaur in its natural habitat How they began to move out of the forests and into humandominated spaces and underwent tremendous behavioural changes to coexist with humans is baffling to the scientific community\n\nWhat facilitates their cohabitation with humans is perhaps their highly adaptable nature Shukla and Khare 1998 in their studies in Pench Wildlife Reserve Central India reported that gaur grazed and browsed on a much wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India It feeds on green grass young leaves and soft shoots during favourable forage conditions at the same time hardly discriminated between low and highquality food during severe seasons Another study titled Diet Composition and Quality in Indian bison based on Fecal Analysis said that gaur is an intermediate or adaptable mixed feeder with the ability to adapt to poorer diets when highquality food is in short supply such as in winter\n\nDiurnal in nature they become nocturnal in conflictprone areas said M Ashok Kumar a wildlife biologist at Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University who has done an extensive study on gaurs in Mudumalai National Park adjacent to the Nilgiris district in 2004 This shift from natural behaviour is now being observed in the Nilgiris as well as in Kodagu\n\nIn Kodagu gaurs venture into human habitations only at dusk and stay away from humans in the day whereas in Coonoor and Kotagiri where the tea plantation does not provide cover like coffee plantations they have overcome their shy nature to survive and coexist with humans all times of the day\n\nThe gaur and the signs of its presence on the streets of Coonoor and Kotagiri in Nilgiris Photo credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nWhat pushed gaurs to leave the forest to navigate humandominated space Ecologist Raman Sukumar of Centre for Ecological Sciences Indian Institute of Science Bangalore points at various possible reasons for this one being a major rinderpest infection among the gaur population in India in 1968 that killed thousands of gaur and a surge in population thereafter Rinderpest also called cattle plague or steppe murrain was a fatal viral disease of cattle domestic buffalo and many other species of eventoed ungulates which was completely eradicated in India\n\nThis is corroborated by M Ashok Kumar The rinderpest infection had done severe damage to the gaur population in India he said It is documented in ERC Davidars book Cheetal Walk where he mentions that one could see gaur carcasses everywhere in Bandipur and Mudumalai The population however picked up soon after the virus was eradicated While there was only one individual per sq km soon after the infection in 2004 we noticed an eightfold increase  eight individuals per sq km he said\n\nGaurs are large bovines that have a wide home range with the individual male home range varying from 135 sq km to 142 sq km and overall individual female home range varying from 32 sq km to 169 sq km shows a study from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve on reintroduced gaurs\n\nThis shows that any forest area less than 50 sq km100 sq km is not viable for the gaur population said Kumar The Nilgiris district with an area of 2545 sq km holds an impressive forest area of 1719 sq km But this forest area is highly fragmented\n\nThe forests in the upper Nilgiris Kotagiri and Coonor areas are small fragmented and the higher elevation shola forests are not suitable for gaur reasons Kumar Changes in land use pattern such as the conversion of natural fallow land a grazing area for gaur for buildings reduces the nonforest habitat available for them\n\nThe district is also known for agriculture with 20192020 estimates showing 7346 sq kmland dedicated to various crops And these agricultural lands are more attractive to gaurs due to their easy accessibility and the presence of grass there Gaurs are grazers said Sukumar More than 80 of their food is grass But due to a surge of invasive plants like Lantana camara in the forests there is probably little grass for them to graze on\n\nKumar said the isolated grasslands which are grazing areas for gaur have been invaded by foreign species like wattle pine and Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius Invasive plants like Lantana camara and Cytisus scoparius give little scope for grass to grow\n\nThe depletion of grass left and invasion of lantana right in the gaurs natural habitats is considered to be one of the reasons the animal moved into agricultural areas for food Photos credit Abhishek N Chinnappa for Mongabay\n\nAnother reason largely speculative though is climate change itself Global warming is changing the behaviour of many species and gaur could be one of them believe scientists\n\nKumar says the sudden proliferation of an invasive plant Senna spectabilis in these areas is a good indicator that climate change is altering landscapes and gaur could well be one of the species altering its behaviour\n\nMost importantly gaur has no natural predators Tigers are the only predators but studies have shown less than 30 of a tigers diet comprises gaur said Kumar They mostly eat cheetal and sambar deer The decline in poaching due to increased protection for wild species is another reason why gaur population is now strong said Sukumar\n\nLet them be\n\nDistrict collector Innocent Divya said despite the tolerance people have for these animals farmers complain of crop loss and demand the forests to be fenced It is not possible to restrain and restrict animals she said This is their land as much as it is ours As far as gaurs are concerned we just need to be mindful If we let them be they let us be\n\nRaman Sukumar said a much softer approach compared to other animals like leopards and elephants can be taken for gaurs since it is possible to live with them Accidents are an aberration otherwise it is possible to live with them he added We need to educate people to stay away from them respect their space\n\nDivya says the district will consider other measures like translocation if their population increases to a point it gets difficult to handle Experts feel translocation to larger adjacent protected areas is the best solution for herbivores like gaurs since they adapt effortlessly in newer environments unlike carnivores Rangeuse pattern and seasonal movements in adjacent areas will shed more light on how these animals are moving between patches said Kumar Identification of corridors can then be the next longterm solution Grassland restoration in gaurs natural habitat is another viable solution that could help prevent interactions with humans\n\nThis article first appeared on Mongabay"
